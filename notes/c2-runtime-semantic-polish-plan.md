# C2 Runtime Semantic Polish Plan

Primary queue context: `notes/source-readiness-triage.md` and
`notes/project-status.md`.

## Current State

`C2` is fully source-backed for the current scaffold phase. The handoff in
`notes/bank-c2-source-scaffold-handoff.md` reports `65536` source bytes,
`0` preserved data-gap bytes, and byte-equivalence `OK`. Remaining work is
semantic polish: stronger struct names, local labels/comments, and cross-bank
contract notes for C0/C1/C3/C4 consumers.

## Subsystem Slices

- Action dispatch: class-2 derived action code construction, action row
  dispatch, second-pointer payloads, item-side and bomb/action continuations.
- Target selection: battler-table population, ranked target lists, steal
  targets, random battler selection, front/back row behavior.
- Status/effect families: affliction mutation, derived stat consequences,
  HP/PP rollers, status tile lookups, solidification and PP-loss handlers.
- PSI/common handlers: PSI menu joins, PSI animation setup, common target/result
  helpers, reflected-hit context rebuild.
- Battle text result flow: C1 battle text callers, C2 action message lanes, EF
  substitution payloads.
- Final Prayer and battle visuals: Final Prayer stages, battle-background
  update/load, swirl overlays, battle sprite/palette-wave helpers.

## First Pass Order

1. Start with C1-facing target/result text contracts because C1 explicitly
   depends on C2 for stable battle front-end names.
2. Polish action dispatch and target selection together so row structures and
   target records get one vocabulary.
3. Move through status/effect and PSI common handlers once the action/result
   contract is stable.
4. Finish with Final Prayer and battle visuals, keeping visual asset table names
   aligned with C4 and CA-CE contract notes.

## Evidence Inputs

- `notes/bank-c2-source-scaffold-handoff.md`
- `notes/bank-c2-working-name-proposals.md`
- `notes/bank-c2-progress-audit.md`
- `notes/c2-battle-contract-workahead.md`
- `notes/c2-ef-battle-text-contract-workahead.md`
- `notes/battle-visual-asset-contracts.md`
- class-2 notes cited by the C2 working-name proposal table

## Expected Outputs

- Source-facing names and comments for battle action, target, status/effect,
  PSI, and visual helper contracts.
- Cross-bank contract notes tying C1 battle front ends and EF substitution data
  to C2 result text and action-table message lanes.
- A list of class-2 leaves that remain intentionally raw or provisional after
  each slice.

## Implementation Notes

- 2026-04-30 first slice: promoted the C1/C2/EF battle-text ABI into source
  comments and local aliases for `C1:DC1C`, `C1:DC66`, `C1:DD9F`,
  `C1:AD0A`, `C1:AD26`, the C2 HP/PP recovery feedback helpers, and the
  battle-start action-table text lane. This is byte-neutral semantic polish;
  the code still relies on byte-equivalence validation as the guardrail.
- 2026-04-30 second slice: named EF status-result scripts at the C2 call sites
  for crying, solidified, asleep, poison, strange, PP drain, and the timed
  shield/substate message pairs. This keeps the C2 source focused on the
  runtime choice being made rather than only the raw EF pointer value.
- 2026-04-30 third slice: cleaned up the remaining local
  `C1DC66_DisplayBattleTextWithNumber` aliases in C2 stat/resource modules.
  PP reduction, guts reduction, offense/defense reduction, odor offense,
  offense-up, defense-down, and battle IQ-increase callers now use local C8/EF

  name buffers, `$5E77/$5E78` article flags, the `D5:9589` enemy-data name
  lookup, party-record fallback through `$99CE + row * 0x5F`, the
  `$AD56/$AD7A/$AD82` front/back battler order lists, and the
  `$A96C/$A96E -> 9FAC + 0x4E * n` target-mask-to-battler rebuild. See
  `notes/c2-action-dispatch-runtime-polish.md` and
  `notes/class2-battlers-table-layout-9f8a-9fac.md`.
- 2026-05-05 fifty-seventh slice: normalized the C2 action/mask source
  vocabulary after the `$9FAC == BATTLERS_TABLE` correction. The affected
  source now names `$9FAC` as `BattlersTableBase`, `0x4E` as `BattlerRowSize`,
  `+0x04/+0x09/+0x0A/+0x0E` as battler action/target/side fields, and the
  mask-helper row tests as consciousness, npc id, row, and affliction bytes.
  Candidate wording is now reserved for the ranked `$AD7A/$AD82` lists in this
  slice. See `notes/c2-action-dispatch-runtime-polish.md` and
  `notes/class2-mask-helper-family.md`.
- 2026-05-05 fifty-eighth slice: returned to the selected-row
  collapse/late-controller route around `C2:7550/7680/77CA`. The promoted
  contracts name the descriptor death-text pointer field, battler
  consciousness/route/row/affliction fields, late active-marker byte `+0x4B`,
  late visual flag `D5:9589 + 0x5A`, active attacker/target pointers, and the
  D5-tagged companion scratch rebuild through `C2:B6EB` at `$A180`. This
  resolves the old `760C` `B6EB` caller bucket as a selected-row companion
  rebuild route, separate from the `4Dxx` battle-start initializer family. See
  `notes/c2-late-selected-row-runtime-polish.md` and
  `notes/class2-b6eb-caller-family-760c.md`.
- 2026-05-05 fifty-ninth slice: tightened the shared PSI timed-substate
  blocker and second-pointer payload consumer after the C1 DD9F tail pointer
  split. `C2:941D` now names the selected/target row pointers, selected-row
  action id and argument byte, `D5:7B68` table root/type byte, PSI action type,
  target timed-substate and countdown bytes, and `$AA94/$AA96` transient flags.
  `C2:40A4` now names `$00BC/$00BE` as the current action-payload pointer and
  `C4:A08D` as the special-case table used by the sibling mask-prune helper.
  See `notes/c2-psi-common-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/class2-psi-shield-post-hit-aa96.md`,
  `notes/c2-action-dispatch-runtime-polish.md`, and
  `notes/class2-second-pointer-consumer-40a4.md`.
- 2026-05-05 sixtieth slice: cleaned up two remaining action-table/payload
  edges outside the main action-dispatch modules. `C2:654C` now names the
  Magic Butterfly PP restore amount, party-slot count, PP target/max-PP fields,
  visual pass constants, and its embedded `D5:7B68` action-type helper.
  `C2:A89D..AF1F` now calls the named `C2:40A4` action-payload applicator at
  its local payload tail. See
  `notes/c2-instant-win-and-magic-butterfly-helpers-c26189-c2654c.md`,
  `notes/c2-item-bomb-runtime-polish.md`, and
  `notes/c2-action-dispatch-runtime-polish.md`.
- 2026-05-05 sixty-first slice: finished the nearby A89D payload-tail mask
  vocabulary pass. The embedded `C2:6E00` helper inside the `6C82` source
  module now has a local source label as the all-active battler target-mask
  builder, `C2:90C6` now calls that role by name, and the A89D item/status
  tail now names the `6BFB/6C82/6E00/6E77/6EF8/70E4` mask-helper sequence
  before handing the selected second-pointer payload to `C2:40A4`. The
  hit-resolution `C2:7EAF` retargeting tail also now calls the named `C2:6EF8`
  first-match finder. See
  `notes/class2-mask-helper-family.md`,
  `notes/class2-late-normalization-and-odor-family-c29051-c29254.md`,
  `notes/c2-item-bomb-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/c2-hit-resolution-status-runtime-polish.md`, and
  `notes/c2-action-dispatch-runtime-polish.md`.
- 2026-05-06 sixty-second slice: returned to the early HP/PP window composer
  and its battle-presentation blink callers. `C2:03C3` now names the
  party-slot map, character record base/stride, HP/PP window option word,
  current HP/PP and dirty/status fields, focused HP/PP window id, tilemap
  base, HP/PP tile-buffer row bases, `C0:8F22` text-length helper, and local
  `C2:0F08/0F26` HP/PP tile-buffer wrappers. The battle-background per-frame
  and cleanup helpers now call `C2:07E1/07B6` by their HP/PP clear/redraw
  roles while naming `$ADA4/$ADA6` as the HP/PP box blink duration/target pair.
  See `notes/c2-window-hppp-and-menu-selection-helpers-c20266-c2108c.md`,
  `notes/c2-battle-bg-load-update-runtime-polish.md`, and
  `notes/c2-battlebg-load-and-palette-effect-corridor-c2cfe5-c2e0e7.md`.
- 2026-05-06 sixty-third slice: moved to the front-door C2 window/text reset
  initializer at `C2:00D1/00D9`. The source now names the open-window chain,
  window-record index/base/stride, text-entry record base/stride, title-upload
  slot table, current focus id, HP/PP tilemap clear range, text display/sound
  latches, and the `C4:3F53` menu/name-entry mask-table reload into `$1AD6`.
  See `notes/c2-symbol-only-stragglers-c200d1-c20d3f.md` and
  `notes/c2-window-hppp-and-menu-selection-helpers-c20266-c2108c.md`.
- 2026-05-06 sixty-fourth slice: tightened the tiny C2 audio/music wrapper
  strip at `C2:16AD/16C9/16D0` and its C1 text-command callers. `C2:16AD`
  now names `$5DD6` as the current map music track and `$5DD4` as the softer
  latched mirror; `C2:16D0` now retires `PLAY_SOUND_AND_UNKNOWN` in favor of
  `PlaySoundAndTickLightWindow`; C1 `1F 00..03` callers now use named C0/C2
  contracts for play-music, stop-music, play-sound, and restore-current-map
  music. See `notes/c2-party-inventory-status-utility-corridor-c216ad-c2307b.md`
  and `notes/text-command-family-1f-deferred-callbacks.md`.
- 2026-05-06 sixty-fifth slice: carried the same caller/callee polish into
  the temporary party source save/restore leaves. C1 `1F 64/65` now names the
  `C2:3008/307B` contracts directly, tying the dynamic source-selector leaves
  to the C2 block that saves `$983A/$983B/$983C/$983E/$9831/$9833`, removes
  the active source ids from `$986F`, and later restores the saved state. See
  `notes/c2-party-inventory-status-utility-corridor-c216ad-c2307b.md` and
  `notes/text-command-family-1f-deferred-callbacks.md`.
- 2026-05-06 sixty-sixth slice: continued the C1 dynamic source-selector
  caller cleanup with the current-interaction-flag leaves. C1 `1F A0/A1/A2`
  now names the `C2:26C5/26E6` wrappers directly, tying set, clear, and read
  text-command behavior to the C2 `$9C88` flag id and `$5D64` refresh target
  contracts. See
  `notes/c2-party-inventory-status-utility-corridor-c216ad-c2307b.md` and
  `notes/text-command-family-1f-deferred-callbacks.md`.
- 2026-05-06 sixty-seventh slice: named the C2 save-current-game wrapper and
  its C1 callers. `C2:2A2C` now names `$B4A1` as the current save slot and
  `EF:0A4D` as the save-slot helper, while preserving inherited
  `SAVE_CURRENT_GAME`; C1 `1F B0` and the debug menu save command both call the
  wrapper by role. See
  `notes/c2-party-inventory-status-utility-corridor-c216ad-c2307b.md` and
  `notes/text-command-family-1f-deferred-callbacks.md`.
- 2026-05-06 sixty-eighth slice: normalized C2's C4 audio caller vocabulary
  after the C0/C4 music contracts stabilized. Candidate-pool setup, instant
  win, rainbow event, Final Prayer, and battle-swirl presentation callers now
  use `C4FBBD_ChangeMusic`; the instant-win tail also names the bicycle track
  and fallback `C0:6A07` current-position music refresh edge. See
  `notes/c2-party-inventory-status-utility-corridor-c216ad-c2307b.md` and
  `notes/c0-current-position-music-refresh-c068f4-c069af.md`.
- 2026-05-06 sixty-ninth slice: tightened the C2 action-dispatch and
  mask-helper contract names now that `$9FAC` is settled as the battler table.
  The mask family now exposes battler-domain aliases for active typed
  battlers, enemy-side battlers, target-parameter matched battlers, all active
  battlers, active NPC battler removal, affliction-flagged pruning, and
  row-state filtering. `C2:4703`, `C2:40A4`, `C2:3D05`, Thunder,
  normalization, and A89D payload-tail consumers now prefer those aliases while
  preserving older `TARGET_*`/candidate labels as compatibility anchors. See
  `notes/c2-action-dispatch-runtime-polish.md` and
  `notes/class2-mask-helper-family.md`.
- 2026-05-06 seventieth slice: carried the battler-table correction into the
  second-stage target/result corridor. `C2:BAC5` now names its 32-row scan as
  filtered second-stage battler-row counting, while `C2:BB18` and `C2:BC5C`
  distinguish six selected-row source-entry passes from the live battler rows
  they mirror into. The source now names the `$9FB8/$9FBA/$9FBB/$9FBC/$9FC9`
  family as source-entry battler fields, `$A972` as the active target battler
  pointer, the `+0x1D..+0x23` collapse-controller state bytes, and the
  `EF:6C6B` collapse/affliction text edge. See
  `notes/c2-target-selection-runtime-polish.md` and
  `notes/c2-late-selected-row-runtime-polish.md`.
- 2026-05-06 seventy-first slice: tightened the shared `C2:724A` status writer
  contract across status/effect leaves. The source now exposes
  `ApplySelectedRowAfflictionSlotValue` for the selected-row `+0x1D + X` slot
  write, preserving `ApplyBattlerAfflictionSubgroupValue` only as a
  compatibility alias. Flash, Freeze, hit-resolution status tails, late status
  actions, asleep/strange wrappers, poison/diamondize physical actions, and
  item-side solidification callers now use the selected-row slot-writer name
  instead of the inherited `INFLICT_STATUS_BATTLE` label. See
  `notes/class2-affliction-apply-helper-724a.md`,
  `notes/c2-psi-flash-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/c2-late-status-runtime-polish.md`, and
  `notes/c2-hit-resolution-status-runtime-polish.md`.
- 2026-05-06 seventy-second slice: named the caller-side `C2:6BB8` contract as
  `RollActionChanceGate` across status, PSI, item, and call-for-help action
  leaves. The same pass finished nearby raw ABI calls in the A89D and A3D1 item
  clusters, so their chance gates, selected-row slot writes, target blockers,
  random rollers, damage applicators, and HP/PP feedback helpers now use
  source-facing contract names while staying byte-neutral. See
  `notes/c2-asleep-status-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/c2-late-status-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/c2-item-bomb-runtime-polish.md`, and
  `notes/c2-call-for-help-runtime-polish.md`.
- 2026-05-06 seventy-third slice: normalized the caller-side `C2:8125` damage
  ABI as `ApplyDamageToSelectedTarget`. Hit-resolution, PSI damage helpers,
  item-side damage/status leaves, bomb splash damage, A89D random-damage
  leaves, and Final Prayer now share one selected-target damage vocabulary,
  while preserving the inherited `CALC_RESIST_DAMAGE` body label. See
  `notes/c2-hit-resolution-status-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/c2-psi-common-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/c2-item-bomb-runtime-polish.md`, and
  `notes/c2-final-prayer-runtime-polish.md`.
- 2026-05-06 seventy-fourth slice: tightened the target/default-text and
  threshold-gate caller vocabulary. Late status, PSI Flash, stat/action leaves,
  hit-resolution tails, and item-side A3D1 now call `C2:7CFD` as
  `CheckSelectedBattlerDefaultTextBlocker`, `C2:7C96` as
  `RollSelectedRowThresholdGate`, and `C2:7CAF` as
  `RollSelectedVsActiveRowOffsetGate` instead of inherited listing labels or
  raw helper addresses. See `notes/c2-late-status-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/c2-hit-resolution-status-runtime-polish.md`, and
  `notes/c2-item-bomb-runtime-polish.md`.
- 2026-05-06 seventy-fifth slice: normalized `C2:6A2D` as
  `GetRandomBelow`, matching the inherited `RAND_LIMIT` body contract. Battle
  action selection, candidate pools, battle-start front/back controllers,
  instant-win present selection, late selected-row gates, hit-resolution rolls,
  PSI/status/stat leaves, A89D item leaves, normalization, and stat-consequence
  dispatch now use the same bounded-random helper name instead of raw `$6A2D`
  or threshold-specific aliases. See
  `notes/c2-steal-and-target-selection-helpers-c241dc-c24434.md`,
  `notes/c2-item-bomb-runtime-polish.md`, and
  `notes/c2-late-normalization-odor-runtime-polish.md`.
- 2026-05-06 seventy-sixth slice: split the adjacent amount-shaping helper
  vocabulary after the bounded-random pass. `C2:6A44` now has a source-body
  label and caller vocabulary as `RollRandomAmount`, while `C2:6AFD` is
  normalized across damage, healing, PP recovery, stat recovery, bottle-rocket,
  Final Prayer, and battle consequence callers as
  `ApplyTwentyFivePercentVariance`. The pass also named the HP/PP recovery
  feedback joins in the `B342/B360` consequence leaves so the shaped amount
  handoff is visible end to end. See `notes/c2-psi-common-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/c2-lifeup-healing-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/c2-stat-consequence-runtime-polish.md`, and
  `notes/c2-item-bomb-runtime-polish.md`.
- 2026-05-06 seventy-seventh slice: tightened the selected-row HP/PP target
  mutation vocabulary around `C2:7126/7191/71F0/721D` and the collapse startup
  join at `C2:7550`. The helper body now exposes `SetBattlerHpTarget`,
  `SetBattlerPpTarget`, `ReduceBattlerHpTarget`, and
  `ReduceBattlerPpTarget`; HP-sucker, PP-drain, hit resolution, and the
  `BCB9..BD13` target-loss sibling now call those names instead of raw setter
  addresses or clamp-only aliases. Raw `C2:7550` long calls in battle-start and
  HP-sucker result flow now use `StartSelectedBattlerCollapseAfflictionPath`.
  See `notes/c2-selected-row-controller-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/c2-pp-loss-and-call-for-help-width-helpers-c2bcb9-c2bd13.md`, and
  `notes/c2-hit-resolution-status-runtime-polish.md`.
- 2026-05-06 seventy-eighth slice: named the C2 local presentation wait helpers
  that sit beside the action-contract helpers. `C2:69BE` is now
  `WaitFrames`, the counted `C1:2DD5` frame-pump loop, and `C2:69DE` is
  `WaitForDisplayTransitionBusyClear`, the matching loop that waits for the
  display-transition busy byte at `$0028` to clear. Final Prayer transitions,
  the finale opener, the selected-row visual refresh paths, and the
  rainbow-colors special event now use these names instead of raw helper
  addresses. See `notes/c2-final-prayer-runtime-polish.md` and
  `notes/class2-prayer-common-helpers-c2c37a-c2c3e2-c2c41f.md`.
- 2026-05-06 seventy-ninth slice: tightened the call-for-help and bomb splash
  width corridor. `C2:EFFD` is now named as `GetBattleSpriteWidthBucket` in the
  bomb splash, call-for-help placement, and active-enemy width-sum callers;
  `C2:BD13` callers now use `SumActiveEnemyBattleSpriteWidths`, the adjacent
  `C2:BD5E` prefix is labeled and called as
  `ApplyCallForHelpEnemySelectionPrefix`, and the hidden `C2:BCE6` target-loss
  sibling is labeled and used as `ApplyBattlerHpTargetLoss`. The call-for-help
  placement path now also names the enemy-row initializer, loaded-sprite-slot
  lookup, and target-text-context refresh joins. See
  `notes/c2-call-for-help-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/c2-pp-loss-and-call-for-help-width-helpers-c2bcb9-c2bd13.md`, and
  `notes/c2-item-bomb-runtime-polish.md`.
- 2026-05-06 eightieth slice: carried established action-dispatch and
  selected-row contracts into the battle-start front/back controller callers.
  The controllers now call the `C2:BAC5` second-stage row counter, `C2:BB18`
  source-entry promoter, `C2:3BCF/3D05` battle-text context builders,
  `C2:4477/4703` derived-action builder/dispatcher, `C2:416F` target-mask
  row-state filter, `C2:7029` mask bit-test helper, `C0:9279` payload
  dispatcher, and `C2:BCB9` PP target-loss helper by source-facing contract
  names instead of raw long-call addresses. See
  `notes/c2-action-dispatch-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/c2-selected-row-controller-runtime-polish.md`, and
  `notes/class2-second-stage-selector-a970.md`.
- 2026-05-06 eighty-first slice: tightened the result-flow corridor around
  instant-win, battle-start completion, and the Time Stop retarget/status tail.
  Instant-win now names `C1:DD47` as `OpenBattleTextWindow`, `C2:B930` as
  `ExportBattleSelectionSnapshot`, and `C2:BAC5` as
  `CountFilteredSecondStageBattlerRows`; battle-start completion names
  `C2:BC5C` as `ClearInactiveSourceEntryLiveSlotTransientFields`; and the
  hit-resolution Time Stop tail now names the `C2:416F` target-mask row-state
  filter plus the `C2:7029` bit-test helper. See
  `notes/c2-battle-start-payload-join-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/c2-instant-win-and-magic-butterfly-helpers-c26189-c2654c.md`,
  `notes/c2-hit-resolution-status-runtime-polish.md`, and
  `notes/class2-second-stage-selector-a970.md`.
- 2026-05-06 eighty-second slice: closed the remaining battle-sprite
  width/slot raw-call edge in the C2 layout lane. `C2:F0D1` and `C2:F121` now
  call `C2:EFFD` as `GetBattleSpriteWidthBucket`, and `C2:F121` calls
  `C2:F09F` as `FindLoadedBattleSpriteSlotById` while writing active enemy
  row `+0x43`. This ties the core battle-sprite row assignment and width
  trimming helpers to the same width and loaded-slot vocabulary already used
  by call-for-help insertion and bomb splash overlap. See
  `notes/c2-battle-sprite-runtime-polish.md` and
  `notes/c2-call-for-help-runtime-polish.md`.
- 2026-05-06 eighty-third slice: named the remaining high-confidence
  C1/C2 presentation lifecycle joins in the battle-start and Final Prayer
  action/result corridors. Battle-start pre-action presentation now calls
  `C2:FEF9` as `LoadOrDimBattlePaletteSet` and its fixed waits through
  `C1:2DD5` / `WindowTick`; battle-start completion now names the
  `C1:DD3B` selected-row presentation refresh and `C1:DD59` battle-text wait.
  Final Prayer stage/narrative transitions now name the `C1:DD3B` and
  `C1:DD47` cleanup/window joins, and the finale loops name `WindowTick` plus
  `WaitForBattleText`. See `notes/c2-battle-start-payload-join-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/c2-final-prayer-runtime-polish.md`, and
  `notes/class2-prayer-common-helpers-c2c37a-c2c3e2-c2c41f.md`.
- 2026-05-06 eighty-fourth slice: carried the same presentation/frame
  lifecycle vocabulary into the battle-start variable-source pool, the opening
  battle-start menu/present controller, Rainbow Colors special-event overlay
  waits, and the Final Prayer finale overlay wait. `C2:4A8A` now names its
  selected-row presentation refresh, `WindowTick`, `C2:DB3F` frame updater,
  `C1:E1A5` enemy-select join, and `C1:DD47` battle-text window open;
  `C2:311B` names its `C2:FEF9` palette load/dim join; `C2:C14E` and
  `C2:C6F0` name `C2:E8C4` overlay start and `C2:E9C8` completion-poll
  helpers. See `notes/c2-battle-start-payload-join-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/class2-candidate-population-and-ranking.md`,
  `notes/class2-special-event-results-c29298-c2c14e.md`, and
  `notes/c2-final-prayer-runtime-polish.md`.
- 2026-05-06 eighty-fifth slice: tightened the battle-start STEAL and cleanup
  helper joins. The front/back controllers now call the source-backed
  `C2:4316` stealable-candidate selector, `C2:4348` pending steal guard,
  `C2:437E` pending stolen-slot applicator, `C1:DDCC` party-member
  presentation selector, `C2:AF1F` battler normalization snapshot/restore,
  `C2:108C` HP/PP roll latch clearer, `C2:0293` title-tile clearer, and
  `C2:E0E7` battle visual flash/layer reset by contract names instead of raw
  long-call addresses. See `notes/c2-battle-start-payload-join-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/c2-steal-and-target-selection-helpers-c241dc-c24434.md`, and
  `notes/c2-window-hppp-and-menu-selection-helpers-c20266-c2108c.md`.
- 2026-05-06 eighty-sixth slice: tightened target/result helper joins across
  action dispatch, battle-start rewards, instant-win, and battler init.
  `CHOOSE_TARGET` now calls `C2:4434` as
  `PickRandomBattlerFromFrontBackRows`; battle-start and instant-win reward
  tails name `C2:281D` as the `DepositIntoAtm` amount converter and `C1:D9E9`
  as `AwardExperienceToCharacter`; instant-win names `C2:E9ED` as the battle
  overlay/layer-effect reset; and `C2:B6EB` names `C2:B66A` as
  `ReadBattlerNameVariantFlag` while leaving the still-soft `B608/B639`
  compact-stat transforms raw. See `notes/c2-action-dispatch-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/c2-steal-and-target-selection-helpers-c241dc-c24434.md`,
  `notes/c2-battle-start-payload-join-runtime-polish.md`,
  `notes/c2-instant-win-and-magic-butterfly-helpers-c26189-c2654c.md`,
  and `notes/class2-local-enemy-id-to-battler-init-chain.md`.
- 2026-05-06 eighty-seventh slice: tightened the hit-resolution result tail
  around physical damage reduction and Time Stop retargeting. `C2:7EAF` now
  calls `C0:925B` as `ShiftMaskedResistanceBits` at the defending and
  shield/power-shield reduction sites, calls `C0:ABE0` as the queued
  sound/effect dispatcher for the target-switch cue, and names the `EF:0256` /
  `EF:026E` music pause/resume helpers around the Time Stop repeated-bash
  loop. See `notes/c2-hit-resolution-status-runtime-polish.md`.
- 2026-05-06 eighty-eighth slice: tightened battle-start front/back helper
  joins against established action-dispatch and HP/PP contracts. The
  `C2:3D05..40A4` source now labels `C2:3E32` as the first-target
  text-context rebuild from the current target mask and `C2:4009` as the
  active-attacker target-mask builder; the front controller calls those labels,
  the `C2:311B` present/message controller, `C4:A228` ranked-target ordinal
  writer, and C1 text/presentation waits by name; and the back controller calls
  `C2:0F9A` as `ClampHpPpRollTargetsToLiveValues` at each result-completion
  branch. See `notes/c2-action-dispatch-runtime-polish.md` and
  `notes/c2-battle-start-payload-join-runtime-polish.md`.
- 2026-05-06 eighty-ninth slice: carried the same helper vocabulary into the
  adjacent battle-start menu and late selected-row controller. `C2:311B` now
  names `EF:0262` as `SetHalfHpPpMeterSpeed`, `EF:026E` as `ResumeMusic`, and
  `C2:0266` as `LoadDefaultTitleUploadTiles`; `C2:77CA` now calls `C2:0F9A`
  as `ClampHpPpRollTargetsToLiveValues` and `C2:3E32` as the current-mask
  first-target text-context rebuild helper, while leaving debug shortcuts and
  still-soft visual refresh helpers raw. See

- 2026-05-06 ninetieth slice: tightened the battle stat-consequence epilogue
  and recovery leaves. `C2:B573..B6EB` now names selector `9` as
  `TryRecoverSelectedBattlerNarrowAffliction`, selector `0x0A` as
  `TryRecoverSelectedBattlerPoisonOnly`, and the optional consequence-record
  byte `+3` handoff through `C0:76C8` as
  `DispatchBattleConsequenceControlByte`. See
  `notes/c2-stat-consequence-runtime-polish.md`.

## Validation

Future implementation passes should use:

```powershell
python tools\build_source_bank_scaffold.py --bank C2
python tools\validate_source_bank_byte_equivalence.py --bank C2 --module all --combined --scaffold src\c2\bank_c2_helpers_asar.asm --strict
python tools\build_source_bank_candidate_ranges_doc.py --bank C2
python tools\build_source_bank_residual_map.py --bank C2
```

This planning pass does not alter C2 source or generated manifests.
