# C2 Hit-Resolution And Status-Action Runtime Polish

Primary queue context: `notes/c2-runtime-semantic-polish-plan.md`,
`notes/c2-ef-battle-text-contract-workahead.md`,
`notes/source-readiness-triage.md`, and `notes/project-status.md`.

## Scope

This pass covers the large `C2:7EAF..8BBE` hit-resolution and late
status-action cluster in
`src/c2/c2_7eaf_run_hit_resolution_and_status_action_cluster.asm`.
The edit is semantic source polish only: it promotes local aliases and
message constants without changing runtime bytes.

## Promoted Contracts

- C1 battle-text ABIs:
  - `C1:DC1C` as direct `$0E/$10` battle-text pointer display.
  - `C1:DC66` as substitution-payload display for damage/stat amount text.
  - `C1:DD7C` as the byte-substitution bridge used by the Spy present script.
- C2 helper ABIs:
  - `C2:3D05` target text-context rebuild.
  - `C2:69F8`, `C2:698B`, `C2:69BE`, `C2:6AFD`, `C2:6BB8`, and
    `C2:6BDB` as shared math/probability helper joins.
  - `C2:6EF8` as the mask-set first-match finder used when the reflected or
    retargeted hit path needs to select a surviving target from the current
    working mask.
  - `C2:7126`, `C2:71F0`, `C2:724A`, `C2:7550`, `C2:7C96`,
    `C2:7CFD`, and `C2:7E8A` as HP/status/default-text/reflection helpers.
    `C2:724A` is now called by its selected-row slot writer role:
    `ApplySelectedRowAfflictionSlotValue`.
- EF battle-text scripts for damage, miss/dodge, SMAAAASH, Spy readouts,
  Time Stop return, no-effect fallback, and late primary-status success text.
- The shield/timed-substate join now uses the EF payload names from the
  `EF:7099..70B1` split: `EF:70B1` is the power-shield physical reflection
  text and `EF:7099` is the shared shield-expired text.

## Spy Readout Payloads

The `BTLACT_SPY` readout now names the target battler fields it samples:

- `+0x26/+0x28` are offense and defense words. Spy stages each current value
  through `C1:DC66`, so the EF scripts at `EF:69EA` and `EF:69FF` consume the
  value as a `1C 0F` amount payload.
- `+0x3A/+0x38/+0x39/+0x37` are fire, freeze, flash, and paralysis
  resistance bytes. The readout emits the matching vulnerability text only
  when the byte is `0xFF`.
- `+0x3C/+0x3B` are hypnosis and brainshock resistance bytes. These drive the
  two Brainshock/Sleep-friendly readout scripts at `EF:6A6C` and `EF:6A7F`.
- The final Check Present branch then reuses `BattlePresentItemByte` as
  described below.

## Shield Reflection Tail

The physical-hit shield branch reads selected row `+0x23` as the active timed
substate id:

- `3` = power shield; reflect the physical hit, emit `EF:70B1`, swap
  attacker/target text contexts through `C2:7E8A`, and apply reflected damage.
- `4` = shield; skip reflection but share the `+0x25` countdown path.
- when row `+0x25` expires, clear row `+0x23` and emit `EF:7099`.

The SMAAAASH path refreshes row `+0x25 = 1` for substates `3` and `4` before
entering the resist-adjusted damage path.

## Status Tails

The late action labels now match the action bodies and EF evidence:

- `BTLACT_DIAMONDIZE` / `C289CE_RunDiamondizeStatusAction`
- `BTLACT_PARALYZE` / `C28A92_RunParalyzeStatusAction`
- `BTLACT_NAUSEATE` / `C28AEB_RunNauseateStatusAction`
- `BTLACT_POISON` / `C28B2C_RunPoisonStatusAction`
- `BTLACT_COLD` / `C28B6D_RunColdStatusAction`

These bodies all feed `C2:724A` with primary status-group constants and then
emit the corresponding EF success script or `EF:766E` no-effect fallback.
The source now calls the named selected-row slot writer directly at each tail.

## Check Present Byte Slot

The `C2:8881` Check Present / Spy tail now names the same
`BattlePresentItemByte` (`$AA10`) slot used by the battle-start present path:

- if the selected target exposes a present byte, C2 stages it through
  `C1:DD7C` into `$9D11`;
- `EF:7DD5` (`MSG_BTL_CHECK_PRESENT_GET`) consumes it through `0x19 0x1F`
  before printing the item name;
- C2 clears `BattlePresentItemByte` after the preview text displays.

This keeps the Check Present branch tied to the C1/EF byte-substitution
contract rather than treating `$AA10` as a generic battle-start scratch byte.

## Follow-Up Mask Join

The retargeting tail now calls the named `C2:6EF8`
`MaskSet_FindFirstMatchInRange` helper instead of a raw long address. That
keeps the hit-resolution cluster aligned with the standalone class-`2` mask
helper note and the A89D item/status payload lane.

## Evidence Inputs

- `refs/EB-M2-Listing-v1/US/bank02.txt` for helper names such as
  `SUCCESS_500`, `SUCCESS_255`, `SUCCESS_LUCK80`,
  `FAIL_ATTACK_ON_NPCS`, `INFLICT_STATUS_BATTLE`, and
  `SWAP_ATTACKER_WITH_TARGET`.
- `refs/EB-M2-Listing-v1/US/bank2F.txt` for EF scripts such as
  `MSG_BTL_DAMAGE`, `MSG_BTL_SMASH_PLAYER`, `MSG_BTL_KIKANAI`,
  `MSG_BTL_DAIYA_ON`, `MSG_BTL_SHIBIRE_ON`, `MSG_BTL_KIMOCHI_ON`,
  `MSG_BTL_MODOKU_ON`, `MSG_BTL_KAZE_ON`, and `MSG_BTL_TIMESTOP_RET`.
- `notes/c2-ef-battle-text-contract-workahead.md` for the C1/C2/EF battle
  text contract vocabulary.

## Validation

Future implementation gates remain the normal C2 scaffold and byte-equivalence
checks:

```powershell
python tools\build_source_bank_scaffold.py --bank C2
python tools\validate_source_bank_byte_equivalence.py --bank C2 --module all --combined --scaffold src\c2\bank_c2_helpers_asar.asm --strict
```
