# Bank E1 First Pass

## Main result

Bank `E1` is a mixed text/font/intro/ending/town-map/audio bank. It contains
flyover text, US font data, photographer/cast/credits data, intro logo and
title-screen assets, ending/cast assets, town-map label/icon assets, town-map
icon placement data, and one audio pack.

Primary artifacts:

- `notes/bank-e1-asset-data-map.md`
- `notes/bank-e1-source-scaffold-handoff.md`
- `build/asset-bank-e1.json`
- `build/e1-build-candidate-ranges.json`
- `build/e1-byte-equivalence-validation.json`

The generated map accounts for:

- binary assets: `43`
- binary asset bytes: `55125`
- asset mix: `8` arrangements, `17` graphics payloads, `12` palettes,
  `5` binary blobs, and `1` audio pack
- table/include bytes: `10397`
- coverage gap bytes: `14`
- source scaffold protected bytes: `65536 / 65536`
- byte-equivalence scaffold validation: `durable-scaffold`, `52` modules,
  `0` non-OK modules, `0` byte mismatches
- missing payload metadata: `4`

- `E1:FFF2..E1:FFFF`: tail slack, `14` bytes.

## Flyover and Credits Handling

The bank config uses `LOCALEINCLUDE` for `coffee.flyover`, `tea.flyover`, and
`flyovers.flyover`. Those source payloads are not present as regular files in
the checked-in tree, but the next known asset begins at `E1:0C7A`, so the
manifest safely treats `E1:0000..E1:0C79` as one combined flyover text span.

`data/credits.asm` exists and uses `EBSTAFF_*` macros. The manifest tool now
counts the US retail byte sizes for those simple macros, so the credits text is
placed as `E1:413F..E1:4DE7` instead of being collapsed to a zero-byte source
include.

## Missing Payload Metadata

Four bank-config binary payloads are not present in `earthbound.yml`:

- `E1AE7C.bin.lzhal`
- `E1AE83.bin.lzhal`
- `E1AEFD.bin.lzhal`
- `E1D6E1.gfx.lzhal`

The manifest can infer the bracketing spans for these payloads even though the
yml metadata is absent. `notes/title-screen-palette-animation-contracts.md`
resolves the former `E1:AE7C..E1:AF7C` followup into the initial, letter, and
glow title palette animation subpayloads, while
`notes/landing-cast-visual-contracts.md` assigns `E1:D6E1..E1:D815` to the
ending cast-scene prelude graphics bundle. The missing-yml fact remains useful
provenance, but these ranges are no longer open semantic blockers.

## Current E1 confidence boundary

High confidence:

- E1 is data/assets, not executable code.
- All major flyover, font, intro, title, ending, town-map, and audio regions are
  bounded for the US retail build.
- The only unclaimed space is `E1:FFF2..E1:FFFF`, `14` bytes.
- `src/e1/bank_e1_helpers_asar.asm` protects the full bank through the reusable
  source-bank scaffold pipeline. The inferred missing payload groups remain
  byte-exact; their checked-in semantic contracts now cover the title palette
  animation and ending cast-name visual support ranges.

Still intentionally out of scope:

- Deciding whether future manifest normalization should split
  `asset.e1.unknown_e1ae7c` into the three title palette-animation subassets.
- Semantic decoding of flyover scripts, photographer config, cast formatting,
  credits-adjacent tables, and remaining unknown E1 table spans.
- Rendering/decompressing intro/title/ending graphics.
- Audio-pack internals.

## Recommended next move

E1 is now closed for byte-preserving scaffold purposes. The remaining work is
semantic polish: use the intro/title, title-palette, title-letter OAM, landing
display, ending cast, and town-map icon contracts for source emission; preserve
missing-yml notes for provenance; promote photographer/flyover/credits-adjacent
table spans only when caller evidence supports field names; and optionally add
render fixtures for the intro/title/ending/town-map assets.
