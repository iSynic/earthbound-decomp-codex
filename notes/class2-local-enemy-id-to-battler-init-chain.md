# Class2 Local Enemy Id To Battler Init Chain

This note captures the first explicit local chain tying `9F8C`, the `D5:9589` enemy-data table, and the `9FAC + 0x4E * n` battler region together.

## Working Names

- `C2:B6EB` = `InitializeEnemyBattlerStatsFromEnemyId`

## Main result

We now have a real local initializer body plus real local callers that tie the model together.

Current safest local chain:

1. bank `C0` builds `9F8A` and `9F8C`
2. bank `C2` computes battler bases in `9FAC + 0x4E * n`
3. bank `C2` calls local `C2:B6EB`
4. `C2:B6EB` maps an enemy id through the `D5:9589` table with stride `0x5E`
5. `C2:B6EB` clears and fills a `0x4E` battler-sized struct at the supplied base

That is the direct local bridge we were missing.

## Local `C2:B6EB` matches `BATTLE_INIT_ENEMY_STATS`

The body at `C2:B6EB` is a very close local match for the reference `BATTLE_INIT_ENEMY_STATS` routine.

Important local byte shape:

- prologue begins at `C2:B6EB`
- stores incoming target base in `$02`
- stores incoming enemy id in `Y` and local `$0F`
- builds `D5:9589 + enemy_id * 0x5E`
- clears a `0x4E` struct at the supplied base through `C0:8EFC`
- reads enemy-data fields and stores them into battler offsets

Strong local field writes include:

- `+0x00` <- enemy id
- `+0x4C` <- enemy id copy
- `+0x02` <- sprite
- `+0x0B` <- result of `C2:B66A` -> matches `the_flag`
- `+0x0C` <- `1` -> matches `consciousness`
- `+0x0E` <- `1` -> matches enemy-side `ally_or_enemy`
- `+0x0F` <- `0` -> matches `npc_id`
- `+0x10` <- enemy-data `row`
- `+0x11/+0x13/+0x15` <- enemy-data HP copied into `hp / hp_target / hp_max`
- `+0x17/+0x19/+0x1B` <- enemy-data PP copied into `pp / pp_target / pp_max`

That is much too close to the reference initializer to treat as coincidence.

## Direct local callers of `C2:B6EB`

The direct caller scan now finds 12 direct call sites to `C2:B6EB`.

Important bank-`C2` callers include:

- `C2:49B1`
- `C2:4A24`
- `C2:4B07`
- `C2:4D01`
- `C2:4D54`
- `C2:760C`
- `C2:7C76`
- `C2:8C45`
- `C2:C0BF`
- `C2:C17D`
- `C2:C359`

There is also one bank-`C1` caller at `C1:E457`.

So this is clearly a live shared initializer, not a one-off analog.

## One explicit local enemy-id -> battler-base call path

The clearest compact local chain is at `C2:4A18+`.

Current safest read:

- `A4 31 / 98 0A / AA / BD 8C 9F` loads one entry from `9F8C`
- `A6 1F` supplies a previously computed battler base in `X`
- `22 EB B6 C2` calls `C2:B6EB`

The matching base computation is visible in the nearby setup logic:

- `A0 4E 00 / 22 F7 8F C0 / 18 69 AC 9F / AA`
- that is exactly `index * 0x4E + 0x9FAC`

So this local path is doing the same high-level work as the reference battle setup loops:

- choose a battler slot
- compute `9FAC + 0x4E * slot`
- load enemy id from `9F8C`
- initialize that battler from enemy data

## Caller-family split now looks meaningful

The caller families no longer all look the same.

Current safest split:

- the `4Dxx -> 4Fxx` family now looks best as a battle-start enemy-group initialization path that later displays encounter text and enemy start-of-battle status lines
- the `760C` caller family still looks different and is probably a separate battler-reinit case

See [class2-b6eb-caller-family-4dxx.md](notes/class2-b6eb-caller-family-4dxx.md) for the corrected `4Dxx` read.

## Why this upgrades the earlier RAM-layout note

Before this step, the `9F8A / 9F8C / 9FAC` interpretation was already strong because of the exact RAM layout match.

Now the local control flow itself supports the same model:

- `9F8C` is not just near the battler table, it is actually used as the enemy-id input to the battler initializer
- `9FAC + 0x4E * n` is not just the right shape, it is actually used as the initializer target base
- `C2:B6EB` is the missing local bridge from enemy ids into battler entries

That moves the model from "exactly matching layout and fields" to "explicit local initialization chain."

## Current safest takeaway

The safest takeaway is:

- `9F8C` is very likely `ENEMIES_IN_BATTLE_IDS`
- `9FAC` is very likely `BATTLERS_TABLE`
- local `C2:B6EB` is very likely `BATTLE_INIT_ENEMY_STATS`
- at least one local caller path already shows the full chain `9F8C enemy id -> C2:B6EB -> 9FAC + 0x4E * n battler`
- the `4Dxx` caller family now reads more like battle-start enemy-group setup than like a call-for-help helper

That is the strongest local confirmation yet for the battle RAM model.

## Best next target

The best next move is to trace the setup that feeds `$4DBC` and `$1D` in the `4Dxx -> 4Fxx` family, or separately decode the unresolved `760C` reinit family so the two battler-init use cases stop sharing one temporary bucket.
