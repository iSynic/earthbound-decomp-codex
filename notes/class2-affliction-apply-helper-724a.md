## Working Names

- `C2:724A` = `ApplySelectedRowAfflictionSlotValue`
- compatibility alias: `ApplyBattlerAfflictionSubgroupValue`

## Main result

`C2:724A` is not best read as a generic random-success helper.

The current safest local model is:

- input `A` = target row base
- input `X` = affliction-group offset relative to row byte `+0x1D`
- input `Y` = new affliction value to apply inside that group
- if target row byte `+0x0F` is nonzero, fail immediately
- otherwise inspect byte `target + 0x1D + X`
- if that byte is zero, write the new `Y` value and succeed
- if that byte is nonzero but smaller than `Y`, overwrite it with `Y` and succeed
- if that byte is nonzero and greater than or equal to `Y`, fail

So `724A` is a grouped affliction install-or-upgrade helper.

## Local body shape

The key local steps are:

1. save incoming `X` to local `$02`
2. move incoming row base `A` into `X` and local `$0E`
3. test target row byte `+0x0F`
4. if nonzero, return `0`
5. compute `target + 0x1D + incoming_X`
6. read the current byte from that location
7. if current is nonzero and `current >= Y`, return `0`
8. otherwise write `Y` back to that same byte and return `1`

That means the helper is deciding whether a new status can replace the existing value in one affliction subgroup byte.

## Why this matters

This finally gives the `X/Y` parameter pairs real local meaning.

### Flash-family callers

From the Flash ladder:

- `C2:98DE` uses `Y = 1`, `X = 3`
  - applies value `1` to row byte `+0x20`
  - success text `EF:6C3A` = `@{target} felt a little strange...`
- `C2:9917` uses `Y = 3`, `X = 0`
  - applies value `3` to row byte `+0x1D`
  - success text `EF:6AE0` = `@{target}'s body became numb!`
- `C2:9950` uses `Y = 2`, `X = 2`
  - applies value `2` to row byte `+0x1F`
  - success text `EF:6BBB` = `@{target} could not stop crying!`

### Additional non-Flash callers

Several non-Flash callers now give more concrete value assignments too:

#### Primary byte `+0x1D`

- `C2:89FD` uses `Y = 2`, `X = 0`
  - success text `EF:6AC7` = `@{target} was diamondized!`
- `C2:91BF` uses `Y = 2`, `X = 0`
  - duplicate diamondized-grade writer in a different wrapper family
- `C2:8AC3` uses `Y = 3`, `X = 0`
  - same primary-byte write as `C2:9917`
  - success text `EF:6AE0` confirms local value `3` again as numbness
- `C2:A027` uses `Y = 3`, `X = 0`
  - duplicate numbness-grade writer in another wrapper family
- `C2:8B04` uses `Y = 4`, `X = 0`
  - success text `EF:6AFB` = `@{target} felt somewhat nauseous...`
- `C2:8FD1` uses `Y = 5`, `X = 0`
  - applies value `5` to row byte `+0x1D`
  - success text `EF:6B18` = `@{target} got poisoned!`
- `C2:8B96` uses `Y = 7`, `X = 0`
  - applies value `7` to row byte `+0x1D`
  - success text `EF:6B2F` = `@{target} caught a cold!`

#### Subgroup byte `+0x1E`

- `C2:8BD5` uses `Y = 1`, `X = 1`
  - applies value `1` to row byte `+0x1E`
  - success text `EF:6B81` = `@{target} began to feel strange!`
  - together with the reference `STATUS_1::MUSHROOMIZED = 1` and the dedicated `BTLACT_MUSHROOMIZE` action file, this is now the strongest current fit for mushroomized
- `C2:8C21` uses `Y = 2`, `X = 1`
  - applies value `2` to row byte `+0x1E`
  - success text `EF:6B98` = `@{target} was possessed by a mini-ghost!`
  - together with the reference `STATUS_1::POSSESSED = 2` and the dedicated `BTLACT_POSSESS` action file, this is now the strongest current fit for possessed
  - together with the `X = 1` family shape, this makes `+0x1E` read much more strongly as the `STATUS_1` subgroup byte rather than spare scratch

#### Subgroup byte `+0x1F`

- `C2:ACB2` uses `Y = 1`, `X = 2`
  - applies value `1` to row byte `+0x1F`
  - success text `EF:6C55` = `@{target} fell asleep!`
- `C2:8C90` and `C2:8E13` both use `Y = 2`, `X = 2`
  - both succeed with `EF:6BBB` = `@{target} could not stop crying!`
- `C2:8CC9` uses `Y = 3`, `X = 2`
  - success text `EF:6BD3` = `@{target} suddenly could not move!`
- `C2:8D12`, `C2:962C`, `C2:A630`, and `C2:A843` all use `Y = 4`, `X = 2`
  - all succeed with `EF:6BEF` = `@{target}'s body solidified!`
  - that lines up exactly with the reference `STATUS_2::SOLIDIFIED`
  - `C2:A630` is now especially useful because [class2-solidification-item-action-c2a5ec-a630.md](notes/class2-solidification-item-action-c2a5ec-a630.md) pins it as the concrete status-apply branch inside live item-side action entry `C2:A5EC`

#### Subgroup byte `+0x20`

- `C2:98DE`, `C2:8DD4`, `C2:A07F`, and `C2:ACF3` all use `Y = 1`, `X = 3`
  - all succeed with `EF:6C3A` = `@{target} felt a little strange...`
  - that makes `+0x20 = 1` very strong as the strange-style subgroup value

Those are not just thematic matches. The helper body itself now says these branches are writing into specific subgroup bytes, and the success texts line up cleanly with the reference affliction enums.

## Stronger field map from this helper

This strengthens the current battler-affliction crosswalk:

- `X = 0` targets the primary ailment byte at `+0x1D`
- `X = 1` targets the subgroup byte at `+0x1E`
- `X = 2` targets the subgroup byte at `+0x1F`
- `X = 3` targets the subgroup byte at `+0x20`

Combined with the already-pinned battle-start texts and the newer non-Flash callers, the safest current read is now:

- row `+0x1D` = primary one-byte ailment enum
  - local values `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `7` are now pinned as diamondized, numbness, nausea, poison, and cold
- row `+0x1E` = `STATUS_1` subgroup byte
  - local value `1` is now the strongest current fit for mushroomized
  - local value `2` is now the strongest current fit for possessed
- row `+0x1F` = `STATUS_2`-style subgroup byte used by asleep, crying, mobility, or body-state values
  - local values `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` are now pinned as asleep, crying, could-not-move, and solidified
- row `+0x20` = `STATUS_3`-style subgroup byte used by strange-style states
  - local value `1` is strongly pinned as strange

This is still slightly cautious as a full global field map, but the subgroup coverage is much better than it was before this pass.

## Current safest takeaway

The safest takeaway is:

- `C2:724A` applies or upgrades a status value inside one affliction subgroup byte
- `X` selects which subgroup byte to touch relative to `+0x1D`
- `Y` is the value written into that subgroup
- the helper succeeds only when the current value is zero or lower-priority than the incoming one
- this no longer just clarifies the Flash family; it now locally confirms primary-byte values for diamondized, numbness, nausea, poison, and cold, plus subgroup values for mushroomized, possessed, asleep, crying, could-not-move, solidified, and strange
- that materially strengthens the battler-affliction field map and the relation between the local row layout and the reference `battler::afflictions` groups

## Phase 2 trace-oracle matrix

The C-port feedback intake keeps this helper in the Phase 2 semantic-closure
lane, but it should be folded in as a trace oracle rather than as a source-name
promotion by itself. The useful oracle shape is a caller matrix with these
columns:

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| caller | concrete C2 entry or wrapper that reaches `C2:724A` |
| selected row source | how the target row is selected or staged before the write |
| X subgroup slot | `X` value and the resulting row byte `+0x1D+X` |
| Y value | status value offered to the writer |
| chance/resistance gate | blocker, threshold, damage-side, or resistance gate before the writer |
| EF text result | success text and no-effect/failure text emitted after the writer |

Representative local rows already backed by notes/source comments:

| Lane | Caller | Selected row source | X slot | Y | Chance/resistance gate | EF text result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flash paralysis | `C2:9917` | Flash selected target after `C2:98A1` | `0 -> +0x1D` | `3` | Flash gate uses selected-row `+0x39`; tier wrappers choose this branch from their random map | `EF:6AE0` on write, `EF:766E` on no-upgrade |
| Late asleep PSI status | `C2:9F06` | selected row from late action body/wrapper | `2 -> +0x1F` | `1` | default blocker, then selected-row `+0x3C` through `C2:6BB8` | `EF:6C55` / `EF:766E` |
| Late paralysis PSI status | `C2:9FFE` | selected row from adjacent late PSI-status tail | `0 -> +0x1D` | `3` | selected-row `+0x37` through `C2:6BB8` | `EF:6AE0` / `EF:766E` |
| Late strange PSI status | `C2:A056` | selected row from strange wrapper/body | `3 -> +0x20` | `1` | selected-row `+0x3B` through `C2:6BB8` | `EF:6C3A` / `EF:766E` |
| Enemy solidification | `C2:8CF1` | late status action selected row | `2 -> +0x1F` | `4` | `C2:7C96` / `RollSelectedRowThresholdGate` | `EF:6BEF` / `EF:766E` |
| Item-side solidification | `C2:A630`, `C2:A82A` | item-side selected row; `A630` follows damage-plus-status setup | `2 -> +0x1F` | `4` | `A630` follows the `A5EC` item damage lane; `A82A` uses `C2:7C96` | `EF:6BEF` / `EF:766E` |
| Persistent late statuses | `C2:8BBE`, `C2:8BFD` | late action selected row | `1 -> +0x1E` | `1`, `2` | default blocker; `8BFD` also checks row `+0x0E` | `EF:6B81`, `EF:6B98`, or `EF:766E` |

Diary-only pressure should stay marked as trace candidates until local traces
pin the row source and gate order. The key candidates are:

- solidification as the lowest-noise repeated `X = 2`, `Y = 4` lane across
  enemy-side and item-side callers
- late status payloads as a compact coverage set for `+0x1E/+0x1F/+0x20`
- Flash paralysis as the small Flash-family `X = 0`, `Y = 3` oracle
- item-side statuses, especially the A89D cluster, as selected-row/action-table
  trace candidates before broad item names are promoted
- concentration seal as an adjacent status-writer lane, but not a `724A` row:
  local evidence has `C2:8D5A/A3D1` directly writing `+0x21 = 4` and emitting
  `EF:6C0B`
- the resist-checked PSI status trio (`C2:9F06`, `C2:9FFE`, `C2:A056`) as one
  host-gate shape candidate with distinct payload rows

## Source-vocabulary update

The C2 source now names `C2:724A` as
`ApplySelectedRowAfflictionSlotValue` and reserves the older
`ApplyBattlerAfflictionSubgroupValue` wording as a compatibility alias. The
new name keeps the ABI anchored to selected-row inputs:

- `A` is the selected-row base
- `X` selects a slot relative to `+0x1D`
- `Y` is the incoming value for that slot
- `+0x0F` is the selected-row route/subtype gate that blocks the write

The direct consumers in Flash, Freeze, late status actions, hit-resolution
status tails, asleep/strange wrappers, poison/diamondize physical actions, and
item-side solidification now call that source alias instead of the inherited
`INFLICT_STATUS_BATTLE` label. The inherited label remains useful as an
upstream reference name, but the source-facing contract now describes the row
slot write being performed.

## Best next target

The best next move is to turn the Phase 2 matrix above into traces: for each
caller, capture the selected row source, `X/Y`, chance or resistance gate,
writer return, and EF result text before promoting any diary-only lane detail.
