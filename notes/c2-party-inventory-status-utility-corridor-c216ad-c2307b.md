# C2 Party, Inventory, Status Utility Corridor `C216AD..C2307B`

This note covers the next C2 audit gap after the early window/HPPP pass. The corridor sits between the event-flag helpers and the scripted battle/menu includes in `refs/ebsrc-main`, and it mostly acts as connective tissue for:

- text command `0x1F` special handlers
- active party/entity registry changes
- character inventory/equipment-slot maintenance
- small status/affliction table lookups
- temporary save/restore of a live party/state scratch block

## Reference anchors

`refs/ebsrc-main/ebsrc-main/src/bankconfig/US/bank02.asm` corroborates the ordering:

- `unknown/C2/C216AD.asm`
- `audio/stop_music_redirect.asm`
- `audio/play_sound_and_unknown.asm`
- `unknown/C2/C216DB.asm`
- named postmath/stat/equipment recalculation family
- `text/get_party_character_name.asm`
- `unknown/C2/C22351.asm`
- `unknown/C2/C2239D.asm`
- `unknown/C2/C223D9.asm`
- `unknown/C2/C22474.asm`

## `C2:16AD`: music/state latch wrapper

`C2:16AD` takes `A`, calls `C4:FBBD`, then stores the original value into both `$5DD4` and `$5DD6`.

Direct callers:

- `C1:4797`
- `C1:842F`

The clearest caller-side clue is `C1:842F`, reached from the text-command `0x1F 03` branch that the legacy reference comments as "restore default music". That path calls `C0:69F7`, passes `X = 0`, then calls `C2:16AD`. So the safest current name is a behavior-level one: this is a music/audio state latch wrapper, not just a raw store into `$5DD4/$5DD6`.

Working name: `ApplyMusicStateAndMirrorTo5DD4`.

## Party overlay and party registry mutations

The previous overlay note already covers `C2:16DB`, `C2:28F8`, and `C2:29BB` in detail. This corridor confirms why they belong in the same local family:

- `C2:28F8` inserts a character/type code into `$986F`, keeping the source array ordered, then calls `C0:369B`, marks the associated sprite/type word with `#$C000`, and for codes `1..4` calls `C2:16DB` and `C3:EBCA`.
- `C2:29BB` removes a code from `$986F`, shifts the remaining entries left, calls `C0:3903`, and for codes `1..4` also calls `C2:16DB` and `C3:EBCA`.

This keeps the existing interpretation strong: `$986F` is the broader active source array, while `$988B` is a derived current-party/type registry layer used by many readers.

`C2:3008` and `C2:307B` are a save/restore pair over a small runtime block that directly touches that same active source array:

### `C2:3008`

This helper:

- copies byte `$983A` to `$9841`
- copies word `$983C` to `$9843`
- copies byte `$983B` to `$9842`
- copies word `$983E` to `$9845`
- removes the byte values in `$983B` and `$983A` from `$986F` through `C2:29BB`
- copies `$9831/$9833` to `$9847/$9849`
- clears `$9831/$9833`

Direct caller: `C1:84FE`, a `0x1F` command leaf.

### `C2:307B`

This helper reverses the above:

- removes the current `$983A/$983B` values from `$986F`
- if `$9841` is nonzero, restores it to `$983A`, reinserts it via `C2:28F8`, and restores `$983C` from `$9843`
- if `$9842` is nonzero, restores it to `$983B`, reinserts it via `C2:28F8`, and restores `$983E` from `$9845`
- restores `$9831/$9833` from `$9847/$9849`

Direct caller: `C1:8505`, the sibling `0x1F` command leaf.

Working names:

- `C2:3008` = `SaveAndClearTemporaryPartySourceState`
- `C2:307B` = `RestoreTemporaryPartySourceState`

The exact user-facing reason for this pair is still soft, but its mechanical role is clear: it temporarily removes up to two active source codes from `$986F`, preserves associated words, and later restores them.

## Character status selector/count helpers

`C2:26F0`, `C2:272F`, and `C2:277C` all scan the party-facing registry at `$988B`, map each code through the `$99CE` character record stride, and inspect byte `$99DC + offset`. Existing notes already identify `$99DC` as the first byte of a seven-byte status/affliction group.

`C2:26F0` returns the first party index whose `$99DC` byte equals `1`, or the loop index after exhausting `$98A4`. This is a "find first state-1 party slot" helper.

`C2:272F` counts party entries whose `$99DC` byte is neither `1` nor `2`. Its direct callers are `C1:51C3` and `C1:5254`, in status/window-facing text command leaves.

`C2:277C` returns the first character code from `$988B` whose `$99DC` byte is neither `1` nor `2`, or `0` if all player-controlled party members have state `1/2`.

Working names:

- `C2:26F0` = `FindFirstPartySlotWithStateOne`
- `C2:272F` = `CountPartySlotsNotStateOneOrTwo`
- `C2:277C` = `FindFirstPartyCodeNotStateOneOrTwo`

The exact enum labels for `$99DC == 1` and `$99DC == 2` remain intentionally unnamed here. The local behavior is pinned; the human-facing ailment/status names still need a tighter cross-reference.

## Status/icon tile lookup helpers

`C2:23D9` and `C2:2474` scan a seven-byte status/affliction slice and convert the first nonzero status byte plus its position into a table value.

Both helpers use this shape:

- start from a pointer in `A`
- inspect the first byte
- otherwise inspect byte `+3`
- otherwise scan bytes `+1..+6`
- derive a small position index
- combine `(status_byte - 1)` and that position index
- read a word from one of the bank-C4 tables

`C2:23D9` has two table modes selected by input `X`:

- `X != 0` uses `C4:5A27`
- `X == 0` uses `C4:5A89`
- if no status byte is found, returns `7` in the nonzero-`X` mode or `#$0020` in the zero-`X` mode

`C2:2474` uses the sibling table `C4:5AEB` and returns `4` if no status byte is found.

Direct callers:

- `C2:23D9` is called by `C2:03C3` twice while composing HP/PP window tilemaps, plus C1 callers at `C1:2180` and `C1:98A6`.
- `C2:2474` is called by `C2:03C3` while building the same HP/PP tilemap family.

Working names:

- `C2:23D9` = `LookupStatusTileValueForHpPpWindow`
- `C2:2474` = `LookupStatusTileWidthOrOffsetForHpPpWindow`

The "tile value" vs "width/offset" wording is still a little cautious because the final consumer writes both values into layout math before tilemap generation.

## Text-command flag wrappers

`C2:26C5` and `C2:26E6` are small wrappers around the existing event-flag bitfield helpers `C2:165E` and `C2:1628`.

`C2:26C5`:

- takes `A` as set/clear value
- loads flag id from `$9C88`
- calls `C2:165E`
- then calls `C0:C30C` with `$5D64`
- returns the updated flag byte

Direct callers are `C1:85AC` and `C1:85B6`, the `0x1F` command leaves that pass `1` and `0`.

`C2:26E6`:

- loads flag id from `$9C88`
- calls `C2:1628`
- returns the flag state

Direct caller is `C1:85BD`, which then prints/returns the numeric result through the text engine.

Working names:

- `C2:26C5` = `SetCurrent9C88FlagAndRefresh5D64`
- `C2:26E6` = `GetCurrent9C88Flag`

## Source Scaffold Promotion

The HP/PP status-tile lookup helpers are now represented as durable source modules:

- `src/c2/c2_23d9_lookup_status_tile_value_for_hp_pp_window.asm` covers `C2:23D9..2474`.
- `src/c2/c2_2474_lookup_status_tile_width_or_offset_for_hp_pp_window.asm` covers `C2:2474..2562`.

Validation after promotion:

- `C2 byte-equivalence: OK, 217 module(s), 0 mismatch(es).`

## Inventory transfer / slot maintenance helper

`C2:2A3A..2F38` is a larger character-inventory transfer helper. Its direct callers are clustered at `C1:39FC`, `C1:3A42`, `C1:3A66`, `C1:3A8A`, `C1:3ACD`, and `C1:3AF0`.

The stable mechanical pieces are:

- input `X` and `Y` behave like source/destination character ids
- input `A` behaves like an item id or staged item byte
- it maps the source character through the `$99F1..$99FE` 14-byte inventory region
- it shifts bytes inside that inventory region and clears the vacated byte
- it calls `C1:8BC6`, the established insertion helper, to insert the transferred/staged item into the destination inventory
- it updates the equipped-slot index bytes `$99FF/$9A00/$9A01/$9A02` when the removed slot position crosses those indices
- it has multiple branches for whether the removed slot matches one of the equipped-slot bytes exactly

That makes the safest current read: `C2:2A3A` is not merely a generic copy helper. It is a transfer/remove/insert helper that preserves the packed inventory plus equipment-slot-index invariants across two character records.

Working name: `TransferInventoryItemBetweenCharactersMaintainingEquipment`.

Source-scaffold promotion split the old broad `C2:2A3A..3008` placeholder into two real source modules:

- `C2:2A3A..2F38` = `TransferInventoryItemBetweenCharactersMaintainingEquipment`
- `C2:2F38..3008` = `InitBattleScripted`, matching `refs/ebsrc-main/ebsrc-main/src/battle/init_scripted.asm`

The exact C1 command labels for the six direct callers remain a separate parser-side naming task.

## Working Names

- `C2:16AD` = `ApplyMusicStateAndMirrorTo5DD4`
- `C2:23D9` = `LookupStatusTileValueForHpPpWindow`
- `C2:2474` = `LookupStatusTileWidthOrOffsetForHpPpWindow`
- `C2:26C5` = `SetCurrent9C88FlagAndRefresh5D64`
- `C2:26E6` = `GetCurrent9C88Flag`
- `C2:26F0` = `FindFirstPartySlotWithStateOne`
- `C2:272F` = `CountPartySlotsNotStateOneOrTwo`
- `C2:277C` = `FindFirstPartyCodeNotStateOneOrTwo`
- `C2:2A3A` = `TransferInventoryItemBetweenCharactersMaintainingEquipment`
- `C2:2F38` = `InitBattleScripted`
- `C2:3008` = `SaveAndClearTemporaryPartySourceState`
- `C2:307B` = `RestoreTemporaryPartySourceState`

## Confidence

High confidence:

- `C2:23D9` / `C2:2474` scan the seven-byte `$99DC`-family status slice and feed HP/PP tile layout.
- `C2:26C5` / `C2:26E6` are wrappers over flag id `$9C88`.
- `C2:3008` / `C2:307B` are a matched save/restore pair over `$983A/$983B/$983C/$983E/$9831/$9833` and `$986F`.
- `C2:2A3A` maintains both packed inventory bytes and equipped-slot indices.

Medium confidence:

- `C2:16AD` as a music/default-audio state latch wrapper. The strongest caller supports it, but `$5DD4/$5DD6` need more downstream naming.
- the exact semantic names for `$99DC` values `1` and `2`.
- the user-facing reason the `0x1F` command pair needs the temporary `$983A/$983B` source-state save/restore.
