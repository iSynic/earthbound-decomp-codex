# C3 Event/Actionscript Semantics Roadmap

This is the front door for the semantic phase after readable source-bank
closure. C3 is byte-equivalent and scaffold-closed, but much of the bank is
interpreted event/actionscript bytecode rather than native 65816 source.

The goal of this phase is to make those scripts understandable, editable, and
eventually reassemblable without guessing.

## Current Baseline

- C3 source scaffold: `src/c3/bank_c3_helpers_asar.asm`
- C3 scaffold coverage: `65536 / 65536` bytes
- C3 residual ranges: `0`
- C3 byte-equivalence: `OK`, `0` mismatches
- Script manifest: `notes/script-payloads-c3.md`
- Source/data map: `notes/c3-source-data-map.md`
- Current promoted script payload labels: `80`
- Current promoted complete event-bytecode decodes: `72`
- Current non-event script-adjacent payloads: `8`
- Current source-form event/actionscript pilots: `140` families, `56518` validated
  bytes
- Source-pilot frontier: `notes/c3-source-pilot-frontier.md` (`0` remaining
  candidate bytes)
- Event/actionscript integration scaffold:
  `src/c3/bank_c3_event_scripts_source_pilot.asar.asm`
- Whole-bank C3 scaffold:
  `src/c3/bank_c3_helpers_asar.asm` (`11` protected ranges, `0` mismatches)

This means the byte layer is stable. The open work is semantic: opcode
contracts, operand meanings, script family roles, and reassembly-friendly source
forms.

## Current Audit

`tools/build_c3_actionscript_semantics_audit.py` regenerates the current
frontier report from `build/c3-source-data-map.json`, `build/ref-index.json`,
and the local ROM. The checked-in report is
`notes/c3-actionscript-semantics-audit.md`.

Current audit result:

- script/actionscript rows audited: `177`
- rows syntactically complete with the current decoder: `177`
- native callback byte-count contract seeds: `85`
- rows blocked by unknown native callback argument contracts: `0`
- unknown event opcodes found: `0`

This shifts the next pass away from opcode discovery and toward semantic
operand names, stable script labels, and script-family source forms.

## Milestone Definition

This milestone is complete when C3 event/actionscript payloads have:

1. an opcode catalog with operand shapes and confidence levels
2. a decoded include-start inventory for every event/actionscript payload row
3. stable labels for branch/call targets used by promoted script families
4. known external callback argument shapes for `EVENT_CALLROUTINE`
5. at least one script family emitted in a reassembly-friendly source form
6. a clear frontier list for unknown opcodes, unknown operands, and VM-adjacent
   payloads that are not event bytecode

## Terminology

- `event-bytecode-asset`: a script payload that should be decoded as event VM
  bytecode, not native 65816.
- `event-bytecode-label`: an internal label or branch target inside an event VM
  bytecode stream.
- `event-script-asset`: an ebsrc event include row that is known to be script
  payload, but has not yet been promoted into local decoded labels.
- `movement-pattern-data`: compact movement/pattern data adjacent to event
  scripts, but not decoded by the event VM.
- `effect-script-asset`: a battle visual effect script or other VM-adjacent
  payload that uses a different interpreter contract.

## Opcode Catalog Seed

The current decoder catalog is in `tools/decode_event_script.py`. Operand names
describe byte shape first; semantic names should tighten as C0/C4 callback and
WRAM contracts improve.

## First Work Packages

### 1. Decoder Coverage Audit

Status: first pass complete in `notes/c3-actionscript-semantics-audit.md`.

Build a report that walks every `event-script-asset`, `event-bytecode-asset`,
and `event-bytecode-label` in `notes/c3-source-data-map.md` and records:

- first opcode
- decoded length before terminal or unknown opcode
- unknown opcode address, if any
- external callback targets
- branch/call targets inside C3
- whether the decode stops by terminal, byte limit, instruction limit, or
  unknown operand shape

This turns the current named-payload manifest into a full C3 script frontier.

### 2. Callback Argument Contracts

`EVENT_CALLROUTINE` is the main semantic bridge from event bytecode into native
C0/C4/EF helpers. `tools/decode_event_script.py` already has a
`CALL_ARG_COUNTS` seed table; the next pass should turn those counts into named
argument contracts where evidence is strong.

High-value callback families:

- C0 current-slot movement and visual profile helpers
- C0 collision/cache wrappers
- C4 vector, display, and text-yield helpers
- EF timed-delivery row/state helpers

remaining candidate bytes.

The next pilots should emit symbolic event bytecode with labels, opcodes, and
operands while preserving byte-equivalence against the ROM-backed scaffold.
Use `tools/build_c3_source_pilot_frontier.py` to rank ready seams before picking
the next family. At the current checkpoint there are no remaining source-pilot
candidate gaps, so the next work should be semantic polish rather than raw pilot
promotion.

### 4. Non-Event Payload Split

Keep these out of the event VM decoder unless evidence changes:

- intro movement pattern records around `C3:9FF2`
- `C3:F819` battle visual effect-script payload
- `C3:FDBD` delivery placeholder sprite table
- compact raw/frontier data rows in `notes/c3-source-data-map.md`

random-wander paths, tunnel-ghost teleport routes, party-look jump/route
terminal paths, party-look registry/random-camera routes, cast-scroll event 801,
Threed escaper late-route tails, and NPC-attention roundwalk/collision/arc tails
now have source-form pilots. The refreshed frontier now has `0` remaining gaps
and `0` ready-ranked gaps. The next best C3 work is no longer raw source-pilot
coverage; it is semantic polish: named operand contracts, tighter callback
argument descriptions, source include integration, and stable script-family docs.
