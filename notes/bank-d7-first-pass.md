# Bank D7 First Pass

## Main result

Bank `D7` is a map-data bank. It continues the map tile chunk run from `D6`,
then contains a generated palette/sector-attribute region, then starts the
compressed map arrangement stream.

Primary artifacts:

- `notes/bank-d7-asset-data-map.md`
- `notes/d7-sector-metadata-contracts.md`
- `notes/d7-sector-metadata-contracts.json`
- `notes/bank-d7-source-scaffold-handoff.md`
- `build/asset-bank-d7.json`
- `build/d7-build-candidate-ranges.json`
- `build/d7-byte-equivalence-validation.json`

The generated map accounts for:

- binary assets: `5`
- binary asset bytes: `56808`
- asset mix: `4` map tile chunks (`bin`) and `1` compressed arrangement
  payload (`arr`)
- inferred generated table bytes: `7680`
- coverage gap bytes: `1048`
- source scaffold protected bytes: `65536 / 65536`
- byte-equivalence scaffold validation: `durable-scaffold`, `7` modules,
  `0` non-OK modules, `0` byte mismatches
- missing payload metadata: `0`

## Bank layout

The high-level D7 layout is:

- `D7:0000..D7:27FF`: `MAP_DATA_TILE_TABLE_CHUNK_7`, `10240` bytes.
- `D7:2800..D7:4FFF`: `MAP_DATA_TILE_TABLE_CHUNK_8`, `10240` bytes.
- `D7:5000..D7:7FFF`: `MAP_DATA_TILE_TABLE_CHUNK_9`, `12288` bytes.
- `D7:8000..D7:A7FF`: `MAP_DATA_TILE_TABLE_CHUNK_10`, `10240` bytes.
- `D7:A800..D7:C5FF`: generated map metadata span, `7680` bytes.
- `D7:C600..D7:FBE7`: `MAP_DATA_TILE_ARRANGEMENT_0`, `13800` bytes.
- `D7:FBE8..D7:FFFF`: tail slack, `1048` bytes.

## Generated Map Metadata

The bank config names two missing generated includes before the first
arrangement payload:

- `data/map/global_tileset_palette_data.asm`
- `data/map/per-sector_attributes.asm`

Those source files are absent from the checked-in reference tree. The next known
binary asset starts at `D7:C600`, so the asset manifest still treats the combined
`D7:A800..D7:C5FF` span as generated map metadata. The consumer-backed semantic
split is now:

- `D7:A800..D7:ACFF`: `D7_SECTOR_TILESET_PALETTE_TABLE`, 1280 one-byte rows.
  Bits `3..7` are `tileset_id`; bits `0..2` are `palette_variant`. This matches
  `notes/map-sector-bundles.json` for all 1280 sectors and is consumed by C0/C4
  landing, movement-strip, secondary-descriptor, spawn-list, and
  tile-arrangement helpers.
- `D7:AD00..D7:B1FF`: bounded 1280-byte metadata plane. No field names are
  promoted yet; the D7 sector contract records value distributions only.
- `D7:B200..D7:BBFF`: `D7_SECTOR_CONTEXT_WORD_TABLE`, 1280 two-byte rows. The
  full word is loaded by `C0:0AA1`; the low three bits match map-sector
  `Setting` for all 1280 sectors and feed spawn-probe, visual-context, and
  path-lane gates. The contract now records `10` distinct high-bit payloads
  (`sector_context_word & 0xFFF8`) across `1062` nonzero high-payload rows, but
  keeps those bits numeric.
- `D7:BC00..D7:C5FF`: bounded 1280-word metadata plane. No field names are
  promoted yet; the D7 sector contract records value distributions only.

## Current D7 confidence boundary

High confidence:

- D7 is data/assets, not executable code.
- `D7:0000..D7:A7FF` completes map tile chunks `7` through `10`.
- `D7:A800..D7:C5FF` is generated map metadata named by the bank config.
- `D7:A800..D7:ACFF` and `D7:B200..D7:BBFF` now have consumer-backed table
  contracts with 1280/1280 sector-bundle matches and explicit consumer-usage
  summaries.
- `notes/d7-sector-metadata-contracts.md` now carries source-emission rows for
  all four D7 metadata planes, including numeric-preserve policies and full
  value counts for the two bounded-but-unnamed planes.
- `D7:C600..D7:FBE7` is compressed map arrangement payload `0`.
- `src/d7/bank_d7_helpers_asar.asm` protects the full bank through the reusable
  source-bank scaffold pipeline.

Still intentionally out of scope:

- Field naming for `D7:AD00..D7:B1FF`, `D7:BC00..D7:C5FF`, and the high bits of
  the `D7:B200` context words.
- Decoding/rendering map tile chunks.
- Decompressing or interpreting arrangement payload `0`.
- Explaining the `1048` bytes of tail slack.

## Recommended next move

D7 is now closed for byte-preserving scaffold purposes, and the strongest
consumer-backed sector metadata fields plus source-emission policies are
promoted. Source emission should split `D7:A800..D7:C5FF` into the four
per-sector planes in `notes/d7-sector-metadata-contracts.md`, preserving the two
unnamed planes and context-word high bits numerically. The remaining D7 work is
narrow semantic polish: identify the two bounded unresolved metadata planes,
decode the high bits of the sector context words if a consumer proves them, and
optionally connect the map tile and arrangement payloads to render fixtures.
