# Project Status

This note is the short, durable orientation for the current state of the
project. It summarizes what is complete, what "complete" means, and what remains
before this becomes true human-readable source.

## Current Baseline

- First-pass bank notes exist for all `48 / 48` configured banks from `C0`
  through `EF`; these are now historical inventory notes, not the live semantic
  work log. The current semantic note package starts at
  `notes/semantic-notes-package.md` and `notes/phase-2-semantic-status.md`.
- Byte-equivalent scaffolds exist for all `48 / 48` banks under `src/<bank>/`.
- Every current bank scaffold is byte-equivalent against the expected ROM:
  `65536` protected bytes, `0` residual bytes, and validation status `OK` for
  each bank.
- EB-M2 Listing v1 is integrated as a credited naming and module-boundary
  reference through generated crosswalk manifests. Meaningful EB-M2 labels are
  preferred only when they are exact-address and role-compatible; `UNKNOWN_*`
  placeholders remain aliases when local names are stronger.
- The restored `refs/ebsrc-main` tree has a generated drift audit at
  `notes/ebsrc-restored-reference-drift-audit.md`. For priority banks `C0`,
  `C1`, `C2`, `C3`, `C4`, and `EF`, every restored ebsrc `unknown/...` entry is
  already superseded by a local source classification or name; ebsrc remains a
  corroborating reference, not a replacement source of truth.
- `notes/source-scaffold-status.md` is the dashboard for the full bank table.
- `notes/readable-source-bank-closure.md` is the stricter dashboard for the
  completed readable-source closure phase: decoded asm versus preserved
  corridors in the source-heavy banks.
- `notes/source-readiness-triage.md` is the generated implementation queue for
  the next semantic phase.
- `notes/semantic-notes-package.md` explains how to read the first-pass notes,
  phase-2 semantic notes, generated dashboards, and ebsrc/community crosswalks.
- `notes/phase-2-semantic-status.md` is the compact human-written status note
  for current subsystem understanding and weak zones.
- `notes/phase-2-semantic-closure-plan.md` is the formal execution roadmap for
  turning byte-equivalent source and manifests into port-ready behavior
  contracts.
- C-port implementation feedback is now folded back into
  `notes/c-port-feedback-intake.md`, especially for C1/C2 battle target,
  payload, affliction, damage, healing, and resource contracts.
- The C2 battle trace-oracle lane now has Mesen runner plumbing, save-state
  probes, fixture-ROM steering, a 141-record manual probe matrix, 6
  trace-observed non-stub results, and 2 proof-grade `refined_contract`
  promotions. The promoted C2 subcontracts cover
  the `C2:8125` damage ABI, selected-row HP mutation, C1 amount-text join,
  HP-to-zero collapse entry, `C2:7550 -> C2:77CA` order, and hard/collapsed row
  state. The controlled resource comparison now separates WRAM-seeded and
  action-row-steered no-WRAM PSI Magnet/PP-reduction amount evidence, and the
  forced-entry `C2:B930` snapshot-export capture is recorded as mechanics
  evidence. The natural snapshot-export scout records 12 existing-save attempts
  and confirms the current saves are mostly `C2:BAC5` neighbors rather than the
  pre-export window. Natural PP amount proof, natural paired `C2:724A`/`C2:9917`,
  and unpatched C1-to-`C2:B930` snapshot export remain the highest-value runtime
  gaps; the next autonomy upgrade is an ignored `C2:2F38` scripted-battle
  fixture ROM.
- The D5 battle-action table now has a generated all-row crosswalk at
  `notes/battle-action-row-crosswalk.md`, separating row `+4` presentation text
  pointers from row `+8` behavior bodies for C1/C2/EF joins without promoting
  new runtime claims.
- Ghidra-SNES `v0.2.0` is installed in the dedicated pilot worktree
  `F:\EB Decomp WT - Ghidra SNES Pilot` as a bounded visual/decode oracle, not
  as a source-of-truth label generator.

## What Is Complete

The structural scaffold phase is complete across the configured ROM banks.

That means the project can reproduce and protect every byte in banks `C0..EF`
through checked-in assembler scaffold files. The scaffolds are stable enough to
use as an organizing layer for romhacking, source extraction, table work, asset
emission, and future porting research.

Readable source-bank closure is also complete for the audited source-heavy
banks: `C0`, `C1`, `C2`, `C4`, and `EF` all report `0` preserved source
corridors in `notes/readable-source-bank-closure.md`.

C3's canonical bank scaffold, `src/c3/bank_c3_helpers_asar.asm`, now replaces
the old opaque event/actionscript corridor with
`src/c3/bank_c3_event_scripts_source_pilot.asar.asm` and validates
byte-equivalent over all `12` protected C3 ranges with `0` mismatches in
`notes/c3-byte-equivalence-validation.md`. The source-pilot corridor now
includes the C3:0100/C3:0142 anti-piracy and faulty-Game-Pak display helpers as
supplemental native source, leaving only the surrounding prefix palette/data and
script-prelude bytes preserved by contract.

The reviewed EB-M2 source-symbol promotion pass has adopted every currently
ready exact-address, non-`UNKNOWN_*`, role-compatible EB-M2 label. Promoted
labels use EB-M2 community names as primary source symbols, preserve the older
address-prefixed local names as assembler aliases/equates, and validate
byte-equivalent in the corresponding bank validation reports.
The remaining `83` EB-M2/local conflicts are now grouped in
`notes/eb-m2-needs-review-triage.md`; the first `CA`/`CC`/`CE` terminal-boundary
batch was resolved as alias-preserving start labels with `0` byte-equivalence
mismatches.

The text-command VM now has a generated semantic manifest at
`notes/text-command-semantics-manifest.md`. It joins the live C1 top-level and
family dispatchers, decoded `C5..C9` text-bank command usage, checked-in
text-command notes, and recovered localization `.MSG` control-command counts.
The current manifest reports `29 / 32` top-level commands covered; the remaining
three are the expected parser-only compressed-bank pseudo-opcodes `0x15..0x17`.
The active text/script asset frontier is now generated at
`notes/text-script-assets-frontier.md`: `168 / 203` family subcommands covered,
`25` live runtime-only family leaves, `9` parsed artifact candidates, and `24`
recovered localization authoring commands without direct runtime hints.
The fuller recovered-source syntax profile at
`notes/localization-authoring-command-frontier.md` now tracks `202` unique
authoring commands, with `80` conservative runtime hints and every remaining
command assigned to a macro-family bucket; `0` commands remain unclassified.
The expansion-model queue at `notes/localization-macro-expansion-frontier.md`
splits those commands into `80` direct runtime hints and `122` macro/markup
commands that need expansion models before text scripts become truly
reassembly-friendly.
The first source-macro lane now has command-only context in
`notes/localization-control-macro-context.md`: `15` control macros, `1904`
hits, and an initial expansion model in
`notes/localization-control-macro-expansion-model.md`. The follow-up pattern
report at `notes/localization-control-macro-patterns.md` scans `685` recovered
source records, finds `180` records with control macros, and isolates `1246`
focus-motif hits without checking in dialogue or full source records. The
sanitized argument-category profile at
`notes/localization-control-macro-lowering-profiles.md` now covers `10` target
commands, `17694` target command hits, and `857` focus-pair hits; it confirms
the strongest compare/call motif as
`@CMP(decimal,decimal) > @ONGOSUB(message_label)`. The first focused lowering
hypothesis is now `notes/localization-cmp-ongosub-lowering.md`; the second is
`notes/localization-set-loopreg-gosub-lowering.md`, covering the broad
`@SET_LOOPREG > @GOSUB` stage-then-call motif across `31` files.
`notes/localization-selgoto-lowering.md` documents the `@SELGOTO` selection
branch macro as a two-target source branch over existing menu/display/branch
VM primitives. `notes/localization-display-inventory-aliases.md` splits the
display and inventory authoring vocabulary into direct `0x1C` / `0x1D` VM
aliases versus higher-level shop/Escargo/display source macros.
`notes/text-vm-localization-semantics-closeout.md` closes this milestone as
phase-good-enough: remaining runtime-only leaves, parser artifacts, authoring
format markers, and higher-level macro lanes are bounded and explicitly
deferred rather than unknown.
The asset/data contract phase now has a closeout boundary at
`notes/phase-4-asset-data-closeout.md` and a generated frontier at
`notes/asset-data-contract-frontier.md`, built by
`tools/build_asset_data_contract_frontier.py` from checked-in
`asset-manifests/*.json` and contract notes. It currently inventories `38`
manifests, `2219` represented assets/tables/gaps, `6175` output recipes,
`1718` assets with preview/swatch recipes, and `1834` assets with decoder
recipes beyond raw extraction. The old E0/E1 manifest-inferred payload
metadata holes are now separated from live unknowns: `5 / 5` are
contract-covered, leaving `0` unresolved missing payload metadata units.
Overworld sprites, map assets, UI/font/town-map assets, battle visual assets,
and audio pack playback/export contracts are good enough for this phase. Mixed
CF/D0 table subrecords and audio exact-duration semantics remain targeted
format/semantics work rather than broad asset discovery.

The audio backend now has a local user-ROM-derived path from EarthBound pack
contracts through fused CHANGE_MUSIC/C0:AB06 snapshots into libgme/snes_spc
rendering. The all-track corpus renders `190 / 190` snapshot-backed tracks as
audible, with track `4` (`NONE2`) correctly classified as load-ok/no-key-on.
The current public boundary is playback/export plumbing plus diagnostic or
policy-driven exports; exact loop points, some finite endings, and independent
external-emulator oracle captures remain open in `notes/audio-export-plan.md`,
`notes/audio-exact-duration-triage.md`, and
`notes/audio-oracle-verification-report-all-tracks.md`.

## Public Good-Enough Definition

For public romhacking and research use, this project should be judged by a
clear boundary rather than by endless polish. A bank or subsystem is
phase-good-enough when:

- its bytes are protected by a checked-in byte-equivalent scaffold
- native source is decoded or explicitly classified as data, text, script, or
  asset payload
- there is no unexplained raw frontier, or the remaining prefix/padding is
  small, bounded, and documented
- important names, table shapes, WRAM fields, and script/text payload roles are
  reflected in generated manifests where possible
- a contributor can find the validation command and the relevant status note
  before editing

The project currently satisfies the first two requirements ROM-wide and for the
audited source-heavy banks. C3 now satisfies the raw-frontier requirement for
this phase: its remaining rows are mixed script/source/data emission work, not
unidentified bank content.

This is enough to call the repository structurally ready for careful community
review once the public README, validation workflow, known-limits page, and
semantic frontiers are presented honestly. It is not enough to call the project
a finished decompilation or a C port.

## Terminology

Use these terms carefully:

- **Scaffold-backed**: bytes are represented in checked-in assembler artifacts
  and pass byte-equivalence validation.
- **Decoded source**: bytes have been converted into instruction-by-instruction
  assembly, table definitions, or typed data emitters.
- **EB-M2 canonical**: a meaningful EB-M2 Listing v1 label has been accepted as
  the public/source-facing name after exact-address and role-compatibility
  review.
- **Semantically understood**: decoded source has reliable names, comments,
  call/data evidence, and subsystem contracts.

All banks are scaffold-backed. The native-code-heavy banks have no remaining
preserved source corridors by the current audit. The next distinction is
semantic: byte-true source/data is not the same as fully documented script,
text, table, graphics, audio, or runtime behavior.

## What Is Not Complete

The project is not yet a full decompilation.

A closed scaffold and a closed readable-source audit prove that the bytes are
accounted for and that native-source corridors are no longer hidden in the
audited source-heavy banks. They do not prove that every routine, data record,
script opcode, text command, or asset payload is semantically understood.

Remaining work is mostly:

- promoting local working names and comments into stable source-facing contracts
- reviewing EB-M2 `keep-local` and `needs-review` cases before any further
  promotion, starting with `notes/eb-m2-needs-review-triage.md`
- turning table and WRAM contracts into typed source/data definitions
- documenting event, action, and text bytecode VM semantics
- making script/text assets reassembly-friendly
- turning remaining manifest-backed graphics, UI/font, EF mixed payloads, and
  audio exact-duration rules into deeper semantic contracts
- building enough semantic models to support higher-level C or engine work

## Best Next Manual Work

The highest leverage work is now semantic, starting with bytecode and payloads
that romhackers need to edit confidently:

1. `C3`: event/actionscript opcode and operand semantics. The first audit is
   now in `notes/c3-actionscript-semantics-audit.md`: `181` rows audited,
   `181` syntactically complete with the current decoder, and `181` carrying
   stable non-`UNKNOWN_C3...` names from checked-in source-pilot labels, with
   `86` native `EVENT_CALLROUTINE` byte-count seeds and `17` installed callback
   target seeds captured. The decoder now prints first-pass semantic operand
   fields for common VM operands and inline callback arguments, so generated
   excerpts show `script_var=var4`, `frames=$08`, and named callback fields
   instead of bare byte lists; high-confidence values such as C0 mutation
   operations, `$5D9A`, and signed velocity/delta words are labeled while
   context-dependent animation/facing literals stay raw. The audit now carries
   a value-semantics readiness layer that separates runtime-boundary-confirmed
   direction/`$2B32` movement words from bounded local-unknown visual-state,
   surface-flag, and pose-descriptor values, with
   `tools/validate_c3_actionscript_semantics_audit.py` enforcing that contract.
   `140` source-form pilots are checked in under `src/c3/event_scripts/` and
   cover `56518` validated bytes. Recent
   additions include Winters battle-BG/Sanctuary display continuations,
   tunnel-ghost teleport routes, photo-scene/window-gfx release paths, early
   turn-bias/visual-countdown halts, traffic-light random-wander paths,
   party-look jump/route terminal paths, cast-scroll event 801, Threed escaper
   late-route tails, and NPC-attention arc tails.
   `notes/c3-source-pilot-frontier.md` now reports `0` remaining candidate
   bytes and `0` frontier gaps. C3 is good enough for this semantics milestone;
   later C3 work should be targeted polish rather than the next blocking lane.
2. `C1` plus `C5..C9`/`EF`: Text VM / Localization Script Semantics and
   reassembly-friendly text payloads. This lane is now good enough for this
   phase; see `notes/text-vm-localization-semantics-closeout.md`. The
   `notes/text-script-assets-frontier.md` is the active work queue for this
   lane. It separates real runtime-only C1 leaves from parser-only
   compressed-bank pseudo-opcodes, likely parser artifacts, and recovered
   localization authoring commands that still need classification. Use
   `notes/localization-macro-expansion-frontier.md` for the follow-up source
   macro expansion queue; `notes/localization-control-macro-context.md` is the
   first concrete lane for control/register/branch macro lowering, with
   `notes/localization-control-macro-patterns.md` now providing local motif
   evidence for `@CMP > @ONGOSUB`, `@SET_LOOPREG > @GOSUB`, and selection
   branch macros. `notes/localization-cmp-ongosub-lowering.md` treats the
   dominant compare/call motif as source-level conditional-call syntax over
   existing bank-`01` Text VM primitives rather than a new runtime opcode.
   `notes/localization-set-loopreg-gosub-lowering.md` treats the broad
   `@SET_LOOPREG > @GOSUB` motif as source-level call-with-staged-argument
   syntax. `notes/localization-selgoto-lowering.md` treats `@SELGOTO` as
   source-level selection branch syntax. Remaining work in this lane is
   targeted follow-up only when needed by concrete text editing, reinsertion,
   or porting tasks.
3. `C0`/`C2`/`C4`: subsystem side-effect docs for overworld, battle, and
   rendering workflows.
4. Asset/data banks: `notes/asset-data-contract-frontier.md` is now the
   phase-4 dashboard, and `notes/phase-4-asset-data-closeout.md` records the
   good-enough boundary. `notes/ui-font-town-map-asset-contracts.md` groups
   `69` E0/E1 assets/tables/gaps into `11` runtime-facing families with `0`
   unresolved missing metadata units. `notes/battle-visual-asset-contracts.md`
   groups `689` CA-CE assets/tables/gaps into `17` runtime-facing families.
   Remaining asset/data work should be targeted: audio-pack format boundaries,
   CF/D0 variable-list subrecords, or semantic polish needed by a concrete
   editor/port task.
