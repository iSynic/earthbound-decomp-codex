# C2 Item And Bomb Runtime Polish

the item-side concentration seal, damage-plus-solidification item action, and
bomb/super-bomb splash-damage contracts.

## Item-Side Concentration Seal

`C2:A3D1` is the item-side sibling of the concentration/PSI-seal family. It
uses the ordinary target gate at `C2:7CFD` and the local eligibility gate at
`C2:8D41`.

On success it writes value `4` to target row `+0x21` and displays `EF:6C0B`.
If the target is ineligible or the byte is already occupied, it displays
`EF:766E`.

The same source unit also contains neighboring item-side helpers such as
HP-sucker and bottle-rocket common paths. HP-sucker is now source-promoted far
enough to name the `EF:7710` self-drain direct text, the `EF:7729`
amount-bearing drain text, and the `C1:DC66` substitution-payload call that
prints the drained HP amount. Its target-max-HP amount roll now calls
`C2:6A44` / `RollRandomAmount` by name, and its target HP loss, user HP gain,
and collapse follow-up now call `ReduceBattlerHpTarget`,
`SetBattlerHpTarget`, and `StartSelectedBattlerCollapseAfflictionPath`
directly.

The bottle-rocket family is now source-promoted as its own neighboring item
slice. `C2:A57A` is the shared `BOTTLE_ROCKET_COMMON` helper; `C2:A5D1`,
`C2:A5DA`, and `C2:A5E3` are the bottle, big-bottle, and multi-bottle wrappers
with attempt counts `1`, `5`, and `20`. Successful attempts use speed-gated
hit checks, `120` damage per hit, 25-percent variance, and resist-adjusted
damage; zero successful hits emits shared no-effect text `EF:766E`.

## Solidification Item

`C2:A5EC` is the damage-plus-solidification item action, strongest local fit for
`BTLACT_HANDBAG_STRAP`.

The action:

- gates through `C2:7CFD` / `CheckSelectedBattlerDefaultTextBlocker`
- applies `C2:7CAF(0x00FA)` / `RollSelectedVsActiveRowOffsetGate`
- computes damage as `0x0064 - target defense`
- applies damage through `C2:8125` / `ApplyDamageToSelectedTarget`
- attempts `C2:724A(target, X=2, Y=4)`

`C2:A630` is the solidification text tail. Success displays `EF:6BEF`; failure
displays `EF:766E`. The source now names the shared `C2:724A`
`ApplySelectedRowAfflictionSlotValue` writer, the EF scripts, the EF
battle-text bank, and the `C1:DC1C` direct-text dispatch.

`C2:A82A` is the direct item-side solidification sibling after the bomb wrappers.
It uses `C2:7C96` / `RollSelectedRowThresholdGate`, applies subgroup `X = 2`,
value `4` through `C2:724A`, and emits the same solidification/no-effect text
pair.

`C2:A86B` is a compact random-damage item leaf. It gates through `C2:7CAF` /
`RollSelectedVsActiveRowOffsetGate`, rolls a `1..4` damage amount with
`C2:6A2D` / `GetRandomBelow`, applies selected-target damage through
`C2:8125` / `ApplyDamageToSelectedTarget`, and emits shared no-effect text on
failure.

## Bomb Common

`C2:A658` is the shared bomb/explosive splash-damage worker. Input A is the base
damage parameter. It applies full shaped damage to the primary target through
`C2:6A44` / `RollRandomAmount` and `C2:8125` /
`ApplyDamageToSelectedTarget`.

When the target is in the battler domain, the helper scans nearby same-side and
same-row battlers, using sprite width and x-position overlap checks. Up to two
secondary targets receive half of the base damage. `$A972` is restored to the
original target before returning.

Wrappers:

- `C2:A818` / `BTLACT_BOMB`: base damage `0x005A` (`90`)
- `C2:A821` / `BTLACT_SUPER_BOMB`: base damage `0x010E` (`270`)

## Random-Damage And Status Item Cluster

`C2:A89D..AF1F` now has source-promoted text contracts for the stable item-side
leaves in the cluster:

- poison and solidification item-status leaves emit `EF:6B18` / `EF:6BEF` or
  shared no-effect `EF:766E` through `C1:DC1C`
- Sudden Guts Pill stages the doubled guts value and emits C8:F80A through the
  `C1:DC66` substitution-payload path
- the item-side defense-up wrapper snapshots row `+0x28`, applies its helper,
  and emits the positive defense delta through C8:F79A plus `C1:DC66`
- the Pray aroma/rending-sound leaves now name the asleep and strange result
  scripts, but the wider Pray dispatcher table remains deliberately local until
  a focused Pray pass ties the C4 text table and effect rows together
- the item/status cluster tail now calls the named
  `C2:40A4` second-pointer payload applicator directly, keeping the local Pray
  and table-driven payload lanes aligned with the broader action-dispatch note
- the same status-payload lane and tail now name their local target-mask
  helpers:
  `C2:6BFB/6C82/6E00/6E77/6EF8` and the `C2:70E4` pruner build, subtract,
  scan, and prune candidate sets before handing the selected second-pointer
  payload to `C2:40A4`

## Decomp Value

This slice tightens several item-side runtime contracts:

- row `+0x21 = 4` has a second concentration/PSI-seal action-table anchor
- row `+0x1F = 4` solidification is tied to item-side damage-plus-status logic
- the direct A630/A82A solidification leaves now share the same local
  affliction-writer and text-dispatch names as the larger A5EC/A89D clusters
- the A89D item-status leaves now share the same direct-text and
  amount-payload ABI names as the earlier A3D1/A5EC and stat-action slices
- the A89D payload tail now names the same `C2:40A4` action-payload applicator
  used by `D5:7B68` second-pointer consumers
- the table-driven A89D payload leaves now share the same named mask-helper
  vocabulary as the standalone class-`2` target-set family
- the A89D item-status and Pray leaves now call their local action chance gate,
  selected-row slot writer, target blocker, random rollers, damage applicator,
  and HP/PP recovery feedback helpers by source-facing contract names
- the A3D1, A5EC, A658, A86B, and A89D item-side damage callers now share the
  `ApplyDamageToSelectedTarget` name for the `C2:8125` selected-target damage
  ABI
- the A3D1 item-side continuation now also names its `C2:7C96` threshold gates
  and uses the same `C2:7CAF` selected-vs-active row offset gate vocabulary as
  A5EC/A86B/A89D
- bomb wrappers now have durable base damage constants
- bomb splash damage is linked to sprite-width and position fields consumed by
  the battle sprite layout/rendering lane
- bottle-rocket wrappers now have durable reference-backed names and attempt
  counts, with the shared speed-gated damage path named locally
- amount-shaping callers now distinguish `C2:6A44` / `RollRandomAmount` from
  `C2:6AFD` / `ApplyTwentyFivePercentVariance`

## Remaining Soft Spots

- whether all `A821` reuses should be named strictly as Super Bomb or broader
  explosive/projectile clones
- final player-facing names for nearby item entries around `A5D1..A5E3`
