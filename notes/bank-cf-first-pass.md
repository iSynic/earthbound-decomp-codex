# Bank CF First Pass

## Main result

Bank `CF` is a generated map-data bank with a small audio tail. It is not code
and not a normal binary-asset bank like `CA` through `CE`.
The follow-up CF splitter now resolves the generated map-data region into exact
source-order spans.

Follow-up source-scaffold status:

- durable scaffold: `src/cf/bank_cf_helpers_asar.asm`
- manifest: `build/cf-build-candidate-ranges.json`
- handoff: `notes/bank-cf-source-scaffold-handoff.md`
- protected bytes: `65536 / 65536`
- residual bytes: `0`
- modules: `11`
- byte-equivalence: `OK`, `0` mismatches

Primary artifacts:

- `notes/bank-cf-asset-data-map.md`
- `notes/cf-table-splits.md`
- `notes/cf-sector-list-contracts.md`
- `notes/cf-door-data-contracts.md`
- `notes/cf-movement-trigger-contracts.md`
- `notes/cf-event-music-context-contracts.md`
- `build/asset-bank-cf.json`
- `build/cf-table-splits.json`

The generated map accounts for:

- binary assets: `2`
- binary asset bytes: `3396`
- table/generator region bytes: `62133`
- exact generated-data split bytes: `62133`
- coverage gap bytes: `7`
- missing payload metadata: `0`

## Bank layout

The high-level CF layout is:

- `CF:0000..CF:F2B4`: generated map-data region, `62133` bytes.
- `CF:F2B5..CF:FF37`: `AUDIO_PACK_94`, `3203` bytes.
- `CF:FF38..CF:FFF8`: `AUDIO_PACK_96`, `193` bytes.
- `CF:FFF9..CF:FFFF`: `7` bytes of tail slack.

The checked-in bank config names the generated map-data sources in order:

- `data/map/door_data.asm`
- `data/map/door_config_table.asm`
- `data/map/overworld_event_music_pointer_table.asm`
- `data/map/overworld_event_music_table.asm`
- an inline ten-byte block
- `data/map/sprite_placement_pointer_table.asm`
- `data/map/sprite_placement_table.asm`
- `data/map/npc_config.asm`

Those files are referenced by `refs/ebsrc-main/ebsrc-main/src/bankconfig/common/bank0f.asm`,
but the actual generated source files are not present under the checked-in
`refs/ebsrc-main/ebsrc-main/src/data` tree. The dedicated splitter recovers
their exact byte ranges from D0 cross-bank door pointers, eb-decompile YAML
shapes, ebsrc struct sizes, the inline byte block, and ROM byte checks.

The exact split is:

- `CF:0000..CF:264E`: `DOOR_DATA`, `9807` bytes.
- `CF:264F..CF:58EE`: `DOOR_CONFIG_TABLE`, 1280 counted sector lists.
- `CF:58EF..CF:5A38`: `OVERWORLD_EVENT_MUSIC_POINTER_TABLE`, 165 word pointers.
- `CF:5A39..CF:61DC`: `OVERWORLD_EVENT_MUSIC_TABLE`, `1956` bytes.
- `CF:61DD..CF:61E6`: inline ten-byte event-music trailer.
- `CF:61E7..CF:6BE6`: `SPRITE_PLACEMENT_POINTER_TABLE`, 1280 word pointers.
- `CF:6BE7..CF:8984`: `SPRITE_PLACEMENT_TABLE`, 627 non-empty counted lists.
- `CF:8985..CF:F2B4`: `NPC_CONFIG_TABLE`, 1584 fixed `0x11`-byte rows.

## Tooling behavior

`tools/build_asset_bank_manifest.py` now skips `config.asm` includes and records
later absent generated includes as covered by the prior inferred generated table
block. This prevents bogus overlapping table spans when a generated region
contains multiple absent source includes before the next known binary asset.

## Current CF confidence boundary

High confidence:

- CF is data/audio, not executable code.
- The generated map-data block runs from `CF:0000` through `CF:F2B4`.
- The internal generated-data spans are exact in `notes/cf-table-splits.md`.
- `DOOR_CONFIG_TABLE` is now a D0-pointer-addressed counted sector-list
  family with 2080 source-order physical movement-trigger rows across 601
  sectors. `notes/cf-sector-list-contracts.md` also records the 19
  overlapping pointer starts that make raw pointer-consumer row scans differ
  from the flat source-order row view, and `notes/cf-sector-list-contracts.json`
  now carries the complete decoded pointer/list/entry rows.
- `DOOR_DATA` now has a partial consumer-backed payload contract for the
  highest-risk movement-trigger variants: type `0` has 6 event-gated script
  pointer records, type `2` has 840 door-transition records used by
  `C0:6BFF`, and type `6` has 6 cached front-interaction pointer records.
- The `DOOR_CONFIG_TABLE` trigger row payload word now has per-type semantics
  for all 2080 source-order physical rows: type `1` selects movement state
  `0x0007`/`0x0008`, type `3` and type `4` feed staged movement selectors,
  and type `5` is bounded as a local no-op payload rather than promoted as a
  pointer family.
- `notes/cf-movement-trigger-contracts.md` now includes a source-emission
  summary by trigger type: 1127 physical rows join to typed `DOOR_DATA`
  records (types `0`, `2`, and `6`), while 953 rows remain non-door numeric
  payloads. Type `5` contributes 220 rows across 100 sectors and 124 unique
  payload words; all 124 unique values fall inside the `DOOR_DATA` byte range,
  but the selected C0 helper is a no-op, so the contract preserves them as
  `no_op_payload_word` instead of pointer offsets.
- `SPRITE_PLACEMENT_POINTER_TABLE` and `SPRITE_PLACEMENT_TABLE` now have a
  counted-list contract: 627 non-empty sector lists, 1582 four-byte placement
  rows, and consumer-backed `npc_config_id`, `sector_local_y`, and
  `sector_local_x` field names. The checked-in JSON includes every decoded
  sector-list and placement row.
- `OVERWORLD_EVENT_MUSIC_POINTER_TABLE` and `OVERWORLD_EVENT_MUSIC_TABLE` now
  have a consumer-backed context contract: selector 0 is the null pointer row,
  selectors 1..164 target 164 CF chains, and the chain parser decodes 489
  four-byte rows through `CF:61DD`. The row fields are named only where C0
  reads them: `event_flag_condition_word`, `music_track`, and
  `screen_transition_sfx`.
- The audio tail contains US retail `AUDIO_PACK_94` and `AUDIO_PACK_96`.
- Only `CF:FFF9..CF:FFFF` remains unclaimed tail slack.

Still intentionally out of scope:

- Gameplay labels for movement states `0x0007`/`0x0008`, staged movement
  selectors, and type `5` pointer-like source bytes remain deferred. The local
  C0 dispatcher keeps type `5` as a no-op, so this pass records the boundary
  without promoting pointer semantics.
- Human names for event flags, track ids, and transition SFX ids remain
  deferred; the event-music context contract keeps those values numeric.
- Audio-pack internals remain opaque.

## Recommended next move

Use the checked-in CF door-data, sector-list, and event-music-context JSON
artifacts, plus the movement-trigger parameter contract, for source emission
planning. The remaining CF semantic work is optional gameplay-label polish and
teaching source-emission tooling to consume the promoted row artifacts.
