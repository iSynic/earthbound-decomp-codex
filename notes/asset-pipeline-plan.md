# Asset Pipeline Plan

This project should keep source control focused on documentation, source scaffolds, manifests, and tools. Copyrighted game payloads should be generated locally from a user-supplied EarthBound ROM and stay under ignored output directories such as `build/assets/`.

## Goals

- Preserve enough ROM provenance that every generated asset can be traced back to a byte range, table, decompressor, or source include.
- Give future ports stable semantic asset IDs instead of forcing engine code to depend on SNES bank addresses.
- Support a legal installer/build flow: the end user supplies the base ROM, the project extracts or decodes assets locally, and no ROM-derived binary payloads are committed.
- Let reference checkouts under `refs/` accelerate naming and format decisions without making them part of the distributable project.
- Keep raw extraction available even before each format decoder is mature, so manifests can land early and decoded outputs can improve over time.

## Contract Layers

1. **ROM recipe layer**: records the source ROM span, table source, expected SHA-1, and any required decoder.
2. **Portable asset layer**: emits local files such as raw `.bin`, preview `.png`, decoded maps, BRR/audio intermediates, text JSON, or engine-ready bundles.
3. **Semantic ID layer**: exposes stable IDs like `asset.debug.cursor_graphics`, `table.map.tileset_pointers`, or `SPRITE_GROUP_NESS_BICYCLE` to tools and eventual ports.
4. **Validation layer**: checks the supplied ROM identity, byte counts, range hashes, and generated output hashes.

Ports should consume the semantic IDs and generated output paths, not hard-code `C0`-style bank ranges except in compatibility shims.

## Repository Policy

- Track manifests, extraction tools, decoder tools, docs, and small generated reports only when they are not ROM-derived payloads.
- Do not track extracted graphics, audio, text dumps, map data, or binary slices from the retail ROM.
- Keep `refs/` ignored. Use it as corroborating evidence for names, formats, and expected asset families.
- Prefer deterministic extraction. The same ROM plus the same manifest should produce the same local outputs and hashes.

## Manifest Shape

Manifests live under `asset-manifests/` and use JSON first, so the tooling needs no third-party YAML dependency. Each asset entry should include:

- `id`: stable engine-facing identifier.
- `title`: human-facing short label.
- `source`: ROM range, expected byte count, expected SHA-1, and evidence links.
- `outputs`: one or more generated files, starting with raw extraction and adding decoded forms as decoders become trustworthy.
- `notes`: uncertainty, likely format, and relationships to source files or reference assets.

The first seed manifest is `asset-manifests/ef-debug-assets.json`, because bank EF already has two small named debug graphics payloads and a validated byte-equivalent scaffold.

## Decoder Roadmap

- **Done in the base pipeline**: raw ROM slices, LZHAL decompression, 2bpp/4bpp tile preview PNGs, SNES BGR555 palette JSON, palette swatch PNGs, first-pass battle-background and battle-sprite palette-aware tile previews, composed battle-background arrangement previews, battle-background scene-layer bundle contracts, size-aware composed battle sprite previews, default-palette overworld sprite previews, overworld sprite group payload/metadata contracts with enum aliases, ROM-extracted overworld sprite frame/slot pointer contracts with named low-bit renderer effects and decoded OAM palette IDs, art-facing overworld sprite animation role contracts, map sprite usage joins, map movement/actionscript pointer usage joins, placed map-object bundle contracts, first-pass map sector bundle contracts, first-pass map tileset bundle contracts, DA map palette long-pointer table contracts, resolved map descriptor palette-to-CGRAM roles for DA BG palettes 2-7, ROM-verified `.fts` 290-row palette variant contracts, parsed `CHANGE_MAP_PALETTE` command usage contracts, structural map collision/attribute bit-family context with D8/WRAM anchors, ROM-verified D8 `.fts` collision pointer contracts, C0-backed map collision runtime-bit contracts, structural map tile-animation/settings row contracts, ROM-verified map tile-animation graphics/upload-script runtime contracts, durable map milestone closure/regeneration tooling, generated overworld slot preview sheets, secondary visual descriptor contracts with pass-terminal markers, prototype composed overworld preview sheets with real overworld sprite palette selection plus optional priority-band and terminal-marker overlays, extraction reports.
- **Next**: finish caller-side labels for the remaining `0x01/0x02` collision low modifier bits and follow the DA map palette metadata words/event-palette selector through runtime use, then continue into BRR/sample packs, text tables, and engine-ready map sector data.
- **Later**: engine-ready asset bundles with IDs, dependency metadata, and loaders that can target native ports or ROM rebuilding.

- Seed generated manifests should land in small, representative batches until the schema is settled, then the remaining asset banks can be generated mechanically.

Existing refs are useful for this phase:

- `refs/eb-decompile-4ef92` has extracted battle sprites, fonts, music, sprite groups, tilesets, town maps, and window graphics.
- `refs/earthbound-disasm-legacy/Earthbound Decomp/EB` has graphics, map data, ROM maps, compressed tilemaps, and font tables.
- `notes/bank-*-asset-data-map.md` already gives us bank-local asset boundaries to convert into manifests.

## Practical Port Path

An eventual port can ship an installer or first-run setup command that:

1. Locates or asks for the user's EarthBound ROM.
2. Verifies the ROM identity.
3. Runs the checked-in asset manifests through extraction and decoder tools.
4. Writes generated assets under a local cache or build directory.
5. Builds or runs the engine against generated local assets.

That keeps the port free to use native formats while preserving a ROM-rebuild path for ROM hacking work.
