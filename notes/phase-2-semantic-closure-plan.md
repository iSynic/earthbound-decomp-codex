# Phase 2 Semantic Closure Plan

Phase 2 is the semantic closure layer after ROM-wide scaffolding and readable
source-bank closure. The goal is not to prove that the bytes exist in source;
that is already covered by the scaffold and byte-equivalence reports. The goal
is to turn byte-equivalent source, data manifests, traces, and reference
crosswalks into behavior contracts that are reliable enough for romhacking,
review, and future C-port work.

## Baseline

- All configured banks `C0..EF` are scaffold-backed.
- Source-heavy banks `C0`, `C1`, `C2`, `C4`, and `EF` have readable-source
  closure for the current phase.
- C3 has byte-equivalent event/actionscript source-pilot coverage and no
  unexplained raw frontier for this milestone.
- Data, asset, text, and audio banks have generated frontiers and targeted
  contract notes rather than broad unknown-bank inventory.
- ebsrc, EB-M2, and C-port feedback are reference inputs. Local source,
  byte-equivalence, traces, and generated manifests remain the proof layer.

## Workstreams

### 1. C2 Battle Contract Closure

Use `notes/c-port-feedback-intake.md` as the first Phase 2 execution queue.
The concrete trace-oracle queue is `notes/c2-battle-trace-oracle-plan.md`.
Its generated companion is `notes/c2-battle-trace-oracle-index.md` plus
`manifests/c2-battle-trace-oracle-plan.json`, refreshed by
`tools/build_c2_battle_trace_oracle_manifest.py` and checked by
`tools/validate_c2_battle_trace_oracle_manifest.py`.
The execution packet is `notes/c2-battle-trace-oracle-packet.md` plus
`manifests/c2-battle-trace-oracle-packet.json`; it writes ignored local jobs,
traces, and stub results under `build/c2/battle-trace-oracles/` and still
requires a real emulator harness before any behavior claim can be promoted.
Collected result status is summarized in
`notes/c2-battle-trace-oracle-results-summary.md`; schema-only stub results
count as plumbing validation, not trace-observed or proof-grade evidence.
The first real-runner handoff is
`notes/c2-battle-trace-oracle-emulator-handoff.md`; it packages the five
first-pass jobs with SNES CPU-bus breakpoint targets, scenario setup notes,
Mesen address-domain caveats, and exact result/output paths.
Ignored runner assets under
`build/c2/battle-trace-oracles/mesen-runner-assets/` add per-job Mesen Lua
skeletons, operator checklists, command snippets, and unresolved result
templates. These assets are execution plumbing only; they do not count as proof
without a reviewed non-stub result.
`tools/build_c2_battle_trace_oracle_result_from_evidence.py` is the bridge from
reviewed trace evidence into the validated result schema.
Prioritize the contracts that most directly affect a C port:

- C1/C2 target staging and selected action metadata.
- `C2:40A4` current-action payload application.
- `C2:724A` affliction/subgroup writer caller matrix.
- `C2:8125` selected-target damage ABI.
- Healing, PP/resource, stat, and amount-bearing leaves.
- PSI Flash/status gates and EF battle-text result joins.

Expected outputs are refreshed subsystem notes, byte-neutral source comments
where evidence is local, and trace-oracle notes where runtime behavior still
needs proof before source promotion.

### 2. C1/EF Text And Battle-Text Joins

Tighten the contracts where text/menu front ends feed runtime behavior:

- C1 battle menus, item/PSI selection, and target prompts into C2.
- EF battle-text row/pointer payloads back into C2 result text.
- Text VM runtime leaves versus localization authoring macros.
- Script/text extraction and reinsertion boundaries for C5..C9 and EF.

Keep localization macro lowering separate from runtime opcode semantics unless
local parser/runtime evidence proves a direct bridge.

### 3. C0/C4 Overworld And Presentation Contracts

Continue subsystem-level polish where static source is strong but side effects
need clearer contracts:

- C0 entity/task, movement, interaction, collision, teleport, input, and audio
  bridge helpers.
- C4 text-tile staging, window/color/HDMA helpers, file-select/town-map
  rendering, credits/photo/cast controllers, and presentation payload islands.
- Cross-bank presentation calls between C0, C1, C2, C4, and EF.

Use emulator probes for PPU, timing, and visual side effects that static source
cannot prove on its own.

### 4. C3 VM, Data, And Source-Emission Semantics

Move C3 and data banks from structural coverage toward source-friendly
contracts:

- Promote event/actionscript operand names, callback argument contracts, and
  control-flow shapes from existing source-pilot evidence.
- Keep bytecode/script source emission conservative until opcode semantics are
  strong enough to round-trip.
- Promote table fields only when consumer evidence proves meaning.
- Preserve unresolved planes and selector bytes numerically with explicit
  source-emission policies.

### 5. Audio Semantics

Keep the source-backed SPC700 work split into two confidence layers:

- Source-backed VCMD labels, argument lengths, and reader paths from the
  checked-in sound-driver source.
- Exact-duration promotion only after local runtime/timing proof.

The priority blockers remain `0x00`, `EF`, `FD`, `FE`, and `0xFF`: distinguish
termination versus return behavior, prove fast-forward timing, and keep `0xFF`
outside the VCMD table unless reader-path evidence proves otherwise.

## Ghidra-SNES Policy

`ghidra-snes v0.2.0` is installed in the dedicated pilot worktree:
`F:\EB Decomp WT - Ghidra SNES Pilot`.

Use it as a supporting oracle only:

- visual HiROM navigation
- independent `65816:LE:24:snes` decode spot-checks
- confusing cross-bank control-flow inspection
- indirect dispatch/table exploration
- C0/C4/EF presentation/runtime sanity checks

Do not use Ghidra as naming authority, as an automated source replacement path,
or as behavioral proof. Any useful Ghidra observation should be recorded as a
hint in notes/manifests, then confirmed against local source, byte-equivalence,
trace data, or generated manifests before source-facing promotion.

The current pilot result is bounded-positive: EarthBound imports as HiROM with
the SNES ROM Loader, sampled lanes decode sensibly, but no materially better
labels or boundaries were discovered beyond local source and crosswalks.

## Validation

- For source-facing edits, run byte-equivalence validation for every touched
  bank.
- For generated manifest/note domains, run the owning builder and validator.
- For roadmap/status changes, rerun source-readiness/readable-source freshness
  checks when the change affects generated dashboards.
- For C2 edge behavior, C4 PPU/timing, and audio duration claims, require local
  trace or emulator evidence before marking behavior as proven.
- Confirm no ROM bytes, scaffold structure, or generated asset payloads change
  unless a task explicitly targets generated artifacts.

## Phase 2 Good-Enough Definition

A subsystem is Phase-2-good-enough when:

- source or data bytes are byte-equivalent and locally navigable
- public names describe stable contracts rather than guesses
- side effects and important WRAM/table fields are documented
- unresolved fields are bounded and preserved numerically
- reference names are crosswalked or aliased without replacing stronger local
  semantics
- future C-port code can identify what is proven, what is inferred, and what
  still needs a runtime oracle
