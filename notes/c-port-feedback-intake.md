# C-Port Feedback Intake

This note folds port-side feedback from
`F:\Earthbound C Port - Codex\docs\decomp-feedback-diary.md` back into this
decomp workspace. It is an intake layer, not a replacement for local proof:
the diary entries are valuable implementation pressure from the C-port lane,
but source labels and behavior claims in this repo should still be backed by
local ASM, byte-equivalence, trace, or manifest evidence before promotion.

Intake snapshot: 2026-05-13.

Entries folded: 36 actionable diary entries, mostly around C2 battle runtime
contracts plus C1 target/item selection bridges and EF battle-text payloads.

## How To Use This Note

- Treat `confirmed` diary entries as strong candidates for comments, tests, and
  port-facing contracts.
- Treat `decomp note candidate` entries as next-note or note-refresh seeds.
- Treat `test oracle` entries as harness work: useful enough to prioritize, but
  not enough to rename source behavior by themselves.
- Keep local source labels primary unless a diary claim is locally verified
  against the checked-in source and validation reports.

## Main Intake Lanes

### C1/C2 Target And Item Staging

The diary reinforces the existing model that C1 owns target/menu selection while
C2 consumes staged battle-action records and target masks:

- `C1:ADB4` remains the shared battle targetting resolver for PSI, item, and
  action-row flows.
- `C1:CE85` and `C1:CFC6` should stay separated: `C1:CFC6` owns the battle
  inventory selection loop, while `C1:CE85` resolves the selected item into the
  item-action/targetting path.
- The useful trace metadata is the candidate row field layout around
  `+0x07`, `+0x08`, and `+0x0A`, especially the selected target/action byte
  before C2 consumes it.
- The target byte shapes from the C-port diary should be checked against local
  traces before being turned into stable names:
  - `0x11` / `0x01`: single/ranked target shapes.
  - `0x12`: row selector shape, with target `1` mapping to row `0` and target
    `2` mapping to row `1` in the observed port harness.

- `notes/c2-target-selection-runtime-polish.md`
- `notes/c2-battle-contract-workahead.md`

### Current-Action Payload Bridge

The strongest repeated diary theme is that many apparent action leaves are
better read as payloads over the current selected target:

- `C2:40A4` is still the right central name for applying the second pointer /
  payload side of a `D5:7B68` action entry.
- Direct curatives, target-loss leaves, food/condiment effects, item-side
  status leaves, HP/PP recovery, and several late status/numeric leaves all
  reuse selected-row or current-action staging.
- Damage/collapse should stay separated in the model: the diary explicitly
  supports collapse finalization after HP roller settlement rather than at the
  moment damage is staged.

- `notes/c2-late-selected-row-runtime-polish.md`
- `notes/c2-lifeup-healing-runtime-polish.md`
- `notes/c2-hit-resolution-status-runtime-polish.md`

### Affliction Writer Matrix

The diary provides useful pressure for treating `C2:724A` as a small reusable
affliction/subgroup writer, with chance and resistance gates modeled separately:

- Solidification, late status payloads, PSI status leaves, Flash paralysis,
  item-side statuses, and concentration-seal paths all converge on the same
  family shape.
- The writer contract should stay parameterized by selected row plus subgroup
  slot/value; separate notes can own individual chance gates.
- Future trace work should build a caller matrix for the `X` / `Y` pairs rather
  than giving every caller a one-off semantic model.

- `notes/c2-psi-flash-runtime-polish.md`
- `notes/c2-concentration-seal-runtime-polish.md`
- `notes/c2-hit-resolution-status-runtime-polish.md`

### Damage Spine And Result Text

The diary strongly supports `C2:8125` as the shared selected-target damage
spine or ABI boundary:

- Random-damage item leaves, bottle rockets, bombs, HP-Sucker, PSI damage
  commons, and Final Prayer-style damage paths are best described by how they
  prepare an amount and then cross the `C2:8125` boundary.
- `C2:8125` should not be overloaded with all downstream meaning. Keep amount
  calculation, guts/survival/collapse, HP roller settlement, and EF result text
  as separate contracts.
- Bombs also tie damage gates to battle sprite geometry; that detail belongs in
  both the C2 bomb note and future presentation/asset-facing contracts.

- `notes/class2-bomb-common-family-c2a658-c2a821.md`
- `notes/c2-ef-battle-text-contract-workahead.md`

### Healing, Resource, And Numeric Payloads

The C-port diary gives a coherent work queue for amount-bearing effects:

- PSI Magnet is a transfer: it has a drained PP amount and a recovery side.
- PP reduction is the loss-only sibling and should not inherit recovery wording.
- Fixed HP and fixed PP recovery mirror each other structurally, but the target
  resource and text contracts should remain explicit.
- Late numeric reducers and stat-up/down leaves have small 16-bit edge behavior
  that deserves local tests before a C port relies on normalized integer widths.
- Healing Gamma and Healing Omega should stay distinct in notes: Gamma is a
  broad recovery gate; Omega is a hard-state full-HP revival wrapper.

- `notes/c2-lifeup-healing-runtime-polish.md`
- `notes/battle-affliction-recovery-family-c29aea-a39d.md`

### PSI Status And Flash Gates

The diary backs the existing split between compact gate families and shared
writers:

- PSI Flash is a trace-gate family over several result/status possibilities.
- The resist-checked PSI status trio should be modeled as one host gate shape
  with distinct payload outcomes.
- Flash paralysis is small enough to be an early local trace oracle for the
  broader `C2:724A` affliction writer model.

## Documentation Follow-Up

The first follow-up should not be more broad inventory. The most useful next
pass is to update a small set of focused notes with diary-backed trace targets:

0. `notes/c2-battle-trace-oracle-plan.md`
1. `notes/battle-targetting-resolver-c1adb4-af50.md`
2. `notes/battle-item-action-selection-c1ce85-c1cfc6.md`
3. `notes/class2-second-pointer-consumer-40a4.md`
4. `notes/class2-affliction-apply-helper-724a.md`
5. `notes/c2-hit-resolution-status-runtime-polish.md`
6. `notes/c2-psi-common-runtime-polish.md`
7. `notes/c2-psi-flash-runtime-polish.md`
8. `notes/c2-lifeup-healing-runtime-polish.md`
9. `notes/c2-late-stat-resource-runtime-polish.md`
10. `notes/c2-ef-battle-text-contract-workahead.md`

For source work, the safest rule is: diary claim -> local note/trace oracle ->
source comment/name only after the local evidence is pinned.
